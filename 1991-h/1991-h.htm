<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> studies in this volume
originally appeared in the &ldquo;St. James&rsquo;s
Gazette.&rdquo;&nbsp; Two, from a friendly hand, have been
omitted here by the author of the rest, as <i>non sua
poma</i>.&nbsp; One was by Mr. <span class="smcap">Richard
Swiveller</span> to a boon companion and brother in the lyric
Apollo; the other, though purporting to have been addressed by
Messrs. <span class="smcap">Dombey</span> &amp; <span
class="smcap">Son</span> to Mr. <span class="smcap">Toots</span>,
is believed, on internal evidence, to have been composed by the
patron of the <span class="smcap">Chicken</span> himself.&nbsp; A
few prefatory notes, an introductory essay, and two letters have
been added.</p>
<p>The portrait in the frontispiece, copied by Mr. T. Hodge from
an old painting in the Club at St. Andrews, is believed to
represent the Baron Bradwardine addressing himself to his
ball.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>FRIENDS
IN FICTION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> fancy which dwells much with
the unborn and immortal characters of Fiction must ask itself,
Did the persons in contemporary novels never meet?&nbsp; In so
little a world their paths must often have crossed, their orbits
must have intersected, though we hear nothing about the adventure
from the accredited narrators.&nbsp; In historical fiction
authors make their people meet real men and women of
history&mdash;Louis XI., Lazarus, Mary Queen of Scots, General
Webbe, Moses, the Man in the Iron Mask, Marie Antoinette; the
list is endless.&nbsp; But novelists, in spite of Mr.
Thackeray&rsquo;s advice to Alexandre Dumas, and of his own
example in &ldquo;Rebecca and Rowena,&rdquo; have not introduced
each other&rsquo;s characters.&nbsp; Dumas never pursued the
fortunes of the Master of Ravenswood after he was picked up by
that coasting vessel in the Kelpie&rsquo;s Flow.&nbsp; Sometimes
a meeting between characters in novels by different hands looked
all but unavoidable.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pendennis&rdquo; and
&ldquo;David Copperfield&rdquo; came out simultaneously in
numbers, yet Pen never encountered Steerforth at the University,
nor did Warrington, in his life of journalism, jostle against a
reporter named David Copperfield.&nbsp; One fears that the Major
would have called Steerforth a tiger, that Pen would have been
very loftily condescending to the nephew of Betsy Trotwood.&nbsp;
But Captain Costigan would scarcely have refused to take a sip of
Mr. Micawber&rsquo;s punch, and I doubt, not that Litimer would
have conspired darkly with Morgan, the Major&rsquo;s sinister
man.&nbsp; Most of those delightful sets of old friends, the
Dickens and Thackeray people, might well have met, though they
belonged to very different worlds.&nbsp; In older novels, too, it
might easily have chanced that Mr. Edward Waverley of Waverley
Honour, came into contact with Lieutenant Booth, or, after the
Forty-five, with Thomas Jones, or, in Scotland, Balmawhapple
might have foregathered with Lieutenant Lismahagow.&nbsp; Might
not even Jeanie Deans have crossed the path of Major Lambert of
the &ldquo;Virginians,&rdquo; and been helped on her way by that
good man?&nbsp; Assuredly Dugald Dalgetty in his wanderings in
search of fights and fortune may have crushed a cup or rattled a
dicebox with four gallant gentlemen of the King&rsquo;s
Mousquetaires.&nbsp; It is agreeable to wonder what all these
very real people would have thought of their companions in the
region of Romance, and to guess how their natures would have
acted and reacted on each other.</p>
<p>This was the idea which suggested the following little essays
in parody.&nbsp; In making them the writer, though an assiduous
and veteran novel reader, had to recognise that after all he
knew, on really intimate and friendly terms, comparatively few
people in the Paradise of Fiction.&nbsp; Setting aside the
dramatic poets and their creations, the children of
Moli&egrave;re and Shakspeare, the reader of novels will find,
may be, that his airy friends are scarce so many as he
deemed.&nbsp; We all know Sancho and the Don, by repute at least;
we have all our memories of Gil Blas; Manon Lescaut does not fade
from the heart, nor her lover, the Chevalier des Grieux, from the
remembrance.&nbsp; Our mental picture of Anna Kar&eacute;nine is
fresh enough and fair enough, but how few can most of us recall
out of the myriad progeny of George Sand!&nbsp; Indiana,
Valentine, L&eacute;lia, do you quite believe in them, would you
know them if you met them in the Paradise of Fiction?&nbsp; Noun
one might recognise, but there is a haziness about La Petite
Fadette.&nbsp; Consuelo, let it be admitted, is not evanescent,
oblivion scatters no poppy over her; but Madame Sand&rsquo;s
later ladies, still more her men, are easily lost in the forests
of fancy.&nbsp; Even their names with difficulty return to us,
and if we read the roll-call, would Horace and Jacques cry
<i>Adsum</i> like the good Colonel?&nbsp; There are living
critics who have all Mr. George Meredith&rsquo;s heroines and
heroes and oddities at their finger ends, and yet forget that
musical name, like the close of a rich hexameter, Clare Doria
Forey.&nbsp; But this is a digression; it is perhaps admitted
that George Sand, so great a novelist, gave the world few
characters who live in and are dear to memory.&nbsp; We can just
fancy one of her dignified later heroines, all self-renunciation
and rural sentiment, preaching in vain to that real woman, Emma
Bovary.&nbsp; <i>Her</i> we know, her we remember, as we remember
few, comparatively, of Balzac&rsquo;s thronging faces, from La
Cousine Bette to S&eacute;raphitus S&eacute;raphita.&nbsp; Many
of those are certain to live and keep their hold, but it is by
dint of long and elaborate preparation, description,
analysis.&nbsp; A stranger intermeddleth not with them, though we
can fancy Lucien de Rubempr&eacute; let loose in a country
neighbourhood of George Sand&rsquo;s, and making sonnets and love
to some rural <i>ch&acirc;telaine</i>, while Vautrin might stray
among the ruffians of Gaboriau, a giant of crime.&nbsp; Among M.
Zola&rsquo;s people, however it may fare with others, I find
myself remembering few: the guilty Hippolytus of &ldquo;La
Cur&eacute;e,&rdquo; the poor girl in &ldquo;La Fortune des
Rougon,&rdquo; the Abb&eacute; Mouret, the artist in
&ldquo;L&rsquo;Oeuvre,&rdquo; and the half idiotic girl of the
farm house, and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne in &ldquo;Un Page
d&rsquo;Amour.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are not amongst M. Zola&rsquo;s
most prominent creations, and it must be some accident that makes
them most memorable and recognisable to one of his readers.</p>
<p>Probably we all notice that the characters of fiction who
remain our intimates, whose words come to our lips often, whose
conduct in this or that situation we could easily forecast, are
the characters whom we met when we were young.&nbsp; We may be
wrong in thinking them the best, the most true and living of the
unborn; perhaps they only seem so real because they came fresh to
fresh hearts and unworn memories.&nbsp; This at least we must
allow for, when we are tempted to say about novelists, &ldquo;The
old are better.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was we who, long ago, were young
and better, better fitted to enjoy and retain the pleasure of
making new visionary acquaintances.&nbsp; If this be so, what an
argument it is in favour of reading the best books first and
earliest in youth!&nbsp; Do the ladies who now find Scott slow,
and Miss Austen dull, and Dickens vulgar, and Thackeray prosy,
and Fielding and Richardson impossible, come to this belief
because they began early with the volumes of the circulating
library?&nbsp; Are their memories happily stored with the words
and deeds of modern fictitious romps, and passionate governesses,
and tremendous guardsmen with huge cigars?&nbsp; Are the people
of&mdash;well, why mention names of living authors?&mdash;of whom
you will&mdash;are those as much to the young readers of 1890 as
Quentin Durward, and Colonel Newcome, and Sam Weller, and Becky
Sharp, and Anne Elliot, and Elizabeth Bennett, and Jane Eyre were
to young readers of 1860?&nbsp; It may very well be so, and we
seniors will not regret our choice, and the young men and maids
will be pleased enough with theirs.&nbsp; Yet it is not
impossible that the old really are better, and do not gain all
their life and permanent charm merely from the unjaded memories
and affections with which we came to them long ago.</p>
<p>We shall never be certain, for even if we tried the experiment
of comparing, we are no longer good judges, our hearts are with
our old friends, whom we think deathless; their birth is far
enough off in time, but they will serve us for ours.</p>
<p>These friends, it has been said, are not such a very numerous
company after all.&nbsp; Most of them are children of our own
soil, their spirits were made in England, or at least in Great
Britain, or, perhaps, came of English stock across the seas, like
our dear old Leather Stocking and Madam Hester Prynne.&nbsp;
Probably most of us are insular enough to confess this
limitation; even if we be so unpatriotic to read far more new
French than new English novels.&nbsp; One may study M. Daudet,
and not remember his Sidonie as we remember Becky, nor his Petit
Chose or his Jack as we remember David Copperfield.&nbsp; In the
Paradise of Fiction are folk of all nations and tongues; but the
English (as Swedenborg saw them doing in his vision of Heaven)
keep very much to themselves.&nbsp; The American visitors, or
some of them, disdain our old acquaintances, and associate with
Russian, Spanish, Lithuanian, Armenian heroes and heroines,
conversing, probably, in some sort of French.&nbsp; Few of us
&ldquo;poor islanders&rdquo; are so cosmopolitan; we read foreign
novels, and yet among all the brilliant persons met there we
remember but a few.&nbsp; Most of my own foreign friends in
fiction wear love-locks and large boots, have rapiers at their
side which they are very ready to draw, are great trenchermen,
mighty fine drinkers, and somewhat gallant in their conduct to
the sex.&nbsp; There is also a citizen or two from
Fureti&egrave;re&rsquo;s &ldquo;Roman Bourgeois,&rdquo; there is
Manon, aforesaid, and a company of picaroons, and an archbishop,
and a lady styled Marianne, and a newly ennobled Count of
mysterious wealth, and two grisettes, named Mimi and Musette,
with their student-lovers.&nbsp; M. Balzac has introduced us to
mystics, and murderers, and old maids, and doctors, and
adventurers, and poets, and a girl with golden eyes, and
malefactors, and bankrupts, and mad old collectors, peasants,
<i>cur&eacute;s</i>, critics, dreamers, debauchees; but all these
are somewhat distant acquaintances, many of them undesirable
acquaintances.&nbsp; In the great &ldquo;Com&eacute;die
Humaine&rdquo; have you a single real friend?&nbsp; Some of
Charles de Bernard&rsquo;s folk are more akin to us, such as
&ldquo;La Femme de Quarante Ans,&rdquo; and the owner of the
hound Justinian, and that drunken artist in
&ldquo;Gerfaut.&rdquo;&nbsp; But an Englishman is rather
friendless, rather an alien and an outcast, in the society of
French fiction.&nbsp; Monsieur de Camors is not of our
<i>monde</i>, nor is the Enfant du Si&egrave;cle; indeed, perhaps
good Monsieur Sylvestre Bonnard is as sympathetic as anyone in
that populous country of modern French romance.&nbsp; Or do you
know Fifi Vollard?</p>
<p>Something must be allowed for strange manners, for exotic
ideas, and ways not our own.&nbsp; More perhaps is due to what,
as Englishmen think, is the lack of <i>humour</i> in the most
brilliant and witty of races.&nbsp; We have friends many in
Moli&egrave;re, in Dumas, in Rabelais; but it is far more
difficult to be familiar, at ease, and happy in the circles to
which Madame Sand, M. Daudet, M. Flaubert, or M. Paul Bourget
introduce us.&nbsp; M. Bourget&rsquo;s old professor, in
&ldquo;Le Disciple,&rdquo; we understand, but he does not
interest himself much in us, and to us he is rather a curiosity,
a &ldquo;character,&rdquo; than an intimate.&nbsp; We are driven
to the belief that humour, with its loving and smiling
observation, is necessary to the author who would make his
persons real and congenial, and, above all, friendly.&nbsp; Now
humour is the quality which Dumas, Moli&egrave;re, and Rabelais
possess conspicuously among Frenchmen.&nbsp; Montaigne has it
too, and makes himself dear to us, as the humorous novelists make
their fancied people dear.&nbsp; Without humour an author may
draw characters distinct and clear, and entertaining, and even
real; but they want atmosphere, and with them we are never
intimate.&nbsp; Mr. Alfred Austin says that &ldquo;we know the
hero or the heroine in prose romance far more familiarly than we
know the hero or heroine in the poem or the drama.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Which of the serious characters in Shakspeare&rsquo;s
plays are not indefinite and shadowy compared with Harry Esmond
or Maggie Tulliver?&rdquo;&nbsp; The <i>serious</i>
characters&mdash;they are seldom very familiar or definite to us
in any kind of literature.&nbsp; One might say, to be sure, that
he knows Hotspur a good deal more intimately than he knows Mr.
Henry Esmond, and that he has a pretty definite idea of Iago,
Othello, Macbeth, King Lear, as definite as he has (to follow Mr.
Austin) of Tito Melema.&nbsp; But we cannot reckon Othello, or
Macbeth, or King Lear as <i>friends</i>; nay, we would rather
drink with the honest ancient.&nbsp; All heroes and the heroines
are usually too august, and also too young, to be friendly with
us; to be handled humorously by their creators.&nbsp; We know
Cuddie Headrigg a great deal better than Henry Morton, and Le
Balafr&eacute; better than Quentin Durward, and Dugald Dalgetty
better than anybody.&nbsp; Humour it is that gives flesh and
blood to the persons of romance; makes Mr. Lenville real, while
Nicholas Nickleby is only a &ldquo;walking
gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; You cannot know Oliver Twist as you know
the Dodger and Charlie Bates.&nbsp; If you met Edward Waverley
you could scarce tell him from another young officer of his time;
but there would be no chance of mistake about the Dugald
creature, or Bailie Nicol Jarvie, or the Baron Bradwardine, or
Balmawhapple.</p>
<p>These ideas might be pushed too far; it might be said that
only the persons in &ldquo;character parts&rdquo;&mdash;more or
less caricatures&mdash;are really vivid in the
recollection.&nbsp; But Colonel Newcome is as real as Captain
Costigan, and George Warrington as the Chevalier Strong.&nbsp;
The hero is commonly too much of a <i>beau
t&eacute;n&eacute;breux</i> to be actual; Scott knew it well, and
in one of his unpublished letters frankly admits that his heroes
are wooden, and no favourites of his own.&nbsp; He had to make
them, as most authors make their heroes, romantic, amorous, and
serious; few of them have the life of Roland Graeme, or even of
Quentin Durward.&nbsp; Ivanhoe might put on the cloak of the
Master of Ravenswood, the Master might wear the armour of the
Disinherited Knight, and the disguise would deceive the
keenest.&nbsp; Nay, Mr. Henry Esmond might pass for either, if
arrayed in appropriate costume.</p>
<p>To treat a hero with humour is difficult in romance, all but
impossible.&nbsp; Hence the heroes are rarely our friends, except
in Fielding, or, now and then, in Thackeray.&nbsp; No book is so
full of friends as the novel that has no hero, but has Rawdon
Crawley, Becky, Lady Jane, Mr. Jim Crawley, MacMurdo, Mrs. Major
O&rsquo;Dowd, and the rest.&nbsp; Even Dobbin is too much the
hero to be admitted among our most kindly acquaintances.&nbsp; So
unlucky are heroes that we know Squire Western and the
Philosopher Square and Parson Adams far better than even that
unheroic hero, Tom Jones, or Joseph Andrews.&nbsp; The humour of
Fielding and his tenderness make Amelia and Sophia far more sure
of our hearts than, let us say, Rowena, or the Fair Maid of
Perth, or Flora MacIvor, or Rose Bradwardine.&nbsp; It is humour
that makes Mr. Collins immortal, and Mrs. Bennett, and Emma;
while a multitude of nice girls in fiction, good girls too, are
as dead as Queen Tiah.</p>
<p>Perhaps, after all, this theory explains why it is so very
hard to recall with vividness the persons of our later
fiction.&nbsp; Humour is not the strong point of novelists
to-day.&nbsp; There may be amateurs who know Mr. Howells&rsquo;s
characters as their elders know Sophia and Amelia and Catherine
Seyton&mdash;there may be.&nbsp; To the old reader of romance,
however earnestly he keeps up with modern fiction, the salt of
life seems often lacking in its puppets or its persons.&nbsp;
Among the creations of living men and women I, for one, feel that
I have two friends at least across the sea, Master Thomas Sawyer
and his companion, Huckleberry Finn.&nbsp; If these are not real
boys, then Dr. Farrar&rsquo;s Eric <i>is</i> a real boy; I cannot
put it stronger.&nbsp; There is a lady on those distant shores
(for she never died of Roman fever) who I may venture to believe
is not unfriendly&mdash;Miss Annie P. Miller&mdash;and there is a
daughter of Mr. Silas Lapham whom one cannot readily forget, and
there is a beery journalist in a &ldquo;Modern Instance,&rdquo;
an acquaintance, a distant professional acquaintance, not a
friend.&nbsp; The rest of the fictitious white population of the
States are shadowy to myself; I have often followed their
fortunes with interest, but the details slip my aging memory,
which recalls Topsy and Uncle Remus.</p>
<p>To speak of new friends at home is a more delicate
matter.&nbsp; A man may have an undue partiality for the airy
children of his friends&rsquo; fancy.&nbsp; Mr. Meredith has
introduced me to an amiable Countess, to a strange country girl
named Rhoda, to a wonderful old &AElig;schylean nurse, to some
genuine boys, to a wise Youth,&mdash;but that society grows as
numerous as brilliant.&nbsp; Mr. Besant has made us friends with
twins of literary and artistic genius, with a very
highly-cultured Fellow of Lothian, with a Son of Vulcan, with a
bevy of fair but rather indistinguishable damsels, like a group
of agreeable-looking girls at a dance.&nbsp; But they are too
busy with their partners to be friendly.&nbsp; We admire them,
but they are unconcerned with us.&nbsp; In Mr. Black&rsquo;s
large family the Whaup seems most congenial to some strangers;
the name of one of Mr. Payn&rsquo;s friendly lads is Legion, and
Miss Broughton&rsquo;s dogs, with <i>their</i> friend Sara, and
Mrs. Moberley, welcome the casual visitor with hospitable
care.&nbsp; Among the kindly children of a later generation one
may number a sailor man with a wooden leg; a Highland gentleman,
who, though landless, bears a king&rsquo;s name; an Irish
chevalier who was out in the &rsquo;45; a Zulu chief who plied
the axe well; a private named Mulvaney in Her Majesty&rsquo;s
Indian army; an elderly sportsman of agile imagination or
unparalleled experience in remote adventure. <a
name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20"
class="citation">[20]</a>&nbsp; All these a person who had once
encountered them would recognise, perhaps, when he was fortunate
enough to find himself in their company.</p>
<p>There are children, too, of a dead author, an author seldom
lauded by critics, who, possibly, have as many living friends as
any modern characters can claim.&nbsp; A very large company of
Christian people are fond of Lord Welter, Charles Ravenshoe,
Flora and Gus, Lady Ascot, the boy who played fives with a brass
button, and a dozen others of Henry Kingsley&rsquo;s men, women,
and children, whom we have laughed with often, and very nearly
cried with.&nbsp; For Henry Kingsley had humour, and his children
are dear to us; while which of Charles Kingsley&rsquo;s far more
famous offspring would be welcome&mdash;unless it were Salvation
Yeo&mdash;if we met them all in the Paradise of Fiction?</p>
<p>It is not very safe, in literature as in life, to speak well
of our friends or of their families.&nbsp; Other readers, other
people, have theirs, whom we may not care much for, whom we may
even chance never to have met.&nbsp; In the following Letters
from Old Friends (mainly reprinted from the &ldquo;St.
James&rsquo;s Gazette&rdquo;), a few of the writers may, to some
who glance at the sketches, be unfamiliar.&nbsp; When Dugald
Dalgetty&rsquo;s epistle on his duel with Aramis was written, a
man of letters proposed to write a reply from Aramis in a certain
journal.&nbsp; But his Editor had never heard of any of the
gentlemen concerned in that affair of honour; had never heard of
Dugald, of Athos, Porthos, Aramis, nor D&rsquo;Artagnan.&nbsp; He
had not been introduced to them.&nbsp; This little book will be
fortunate far beyond its deserts if it tempts a few readers to
extend the circle of their visionary acquaintances, of friends
who, like Brahma, know not birth, nor decay, &ldquo;sleep,
waking, nor trance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A theme more delicate and intimate than that of our Friends in
fiction awaits a more passionate writer than the present
parodist.&nbsp; Our <i>Loves</i> in fiction are probably
numerous, and our choice depends on age and temperament.&nbsp; In
romance, if not in life, we can be in love with a number of
ladies at once.&nbsp; It is probable that Beatrix Esmond has not
fewer knights than Marie Antoinette or Mary Stuart.&nbsp; These
ladies have been the marks of scandal.&nbsp; Unkind things are
said of all three, but our hearts do not believe the evil
reports.&nbsp; Sir Walter Scott refused to write a life of Mary
Stuart because his opinion was not on the popular side, nor on
the side of his feelings.&nbsp; The reasoning and judicial
faculties may be convinced that Beatrix was &ldquo;other than a
guid ane,&rdquo; but reason does not touch the affections; we see
her with the eyes of Harry Esmond, and, like him, &ldquo;remember
a paragon.&rdquo;&nbsp; With similar lack of logic we believe
that Mrs. Wenham really had one of her headaches, and that Becky
was guiltless on a notorious occasion.&nbsp; Bad or not so bad,
what lady would we so gladly meet as Mrs. Rawdon Crawley, whose
kindness was so great that she even condescended to be amusing to
her own husband?&nbsp; For a more serious and life-long affection
there are few heroines so satisfactory as Sophia Western and
Amelia Booth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Harris).&nbsp; Never before nor
since did a man&rsquo;s ideal put on flesh and blood&mdash;out of
poetry, that is,&mdash;and apart from the ladies of
Shakspeare.&nbsp; Fielding&rsquo;s women have a manly honour,
tolerance, greatness, in addition to their tenderness and
kindness.&nbsp; Literature has not their peers, and life has
never had many to compare with them.&nbsp; They are not
&ldquo;superior&rdquo; like Romola, nor flighty and destitute of
taste like Maggie Tulliver; among Fielding&rsquo;s crowd of
fribbles and sots and oafs they carry that pure moly of the Lady
in &ldquo;Comus.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is curious, indeed, that men
have drawn women more true and charming than women themselves
have invented, and the heroines of George Eliot, of George Sand
(except Consuelo), and even of Miss Austen, do not subdue us like
Di Vernon, nor win our sympathies like Rebecca of York.&nbsp;
They may please and charm for their hour, but they have not the
immortality of the first heroines of all&mdash;of Helen, or of
that Alcmena who makes even comedy grave when she enters, and
even Plautus chivalrous.&nbsp; Poetry, rather than prose fiction,
is the proper home of our spiritual mistresses; they dwell where
Rosalind and Imogen are, with women perhaps as unreal or as ideal
as themselves, men&rsquo;s lost loves and unforgotten, in a
Paradise apart.</p>

Yesterday&rsquo;s Daisy, yesterday&rsquo;s Rose, were it of

les neiges d&rsquo;automne</i>?&nbsp; However,
yesterday&mdash;the day before yesterday, rather&mdash;Miss Annie
P. Miller was well enough.</p>
<p>We were smoking at the club windows on the Ponte Vecchio;
Marmalada, Giovanelli of the Bersaglieri, young Ponto of the
K.O.B.&rsquo;s, and myself&mdash;men who never give a thought
save to the gold embroidery of their <i>pantoufles</i> or the
exquisite ebon laquer of their Russia leather
cricket-shoes.&nbsp; Suddenly we heard a clatter in the
streets.&nbsp; The riderless chargers of the Bersaglieri were
racing down the Santo Croce, and just turning, with a swing and
shriek of clattering spurs, into the Maremma.&nbsp; In the midst
of the street, under our very window, was a little thing like a
butterfly, with <i>yeux de pervenche</i>.&nbsp; You remember,
Camarada, Voltaire&rsquo;s love of the <i>pervenche</i>; we have
plucked it, have we not? in his garden of Les Charmettes.&nbsp;
<i>Nous n&rsquo;irons plus aux bois</i>!&nbsp; <i>Basta</i>!</p>
<p>But to return.&nbsp; There she stood, terror-stricken,
petrified, like her who of old turned her back on Zoar and beheld
the incandescent hurricane of hail smite the City of the
Plain!&nbsp; She was dressed in white muslin, <i>joli comme un
c&oelig;ur</i>, with a myriad frills and flounces and knots of
pale-coloured ribbon.&nbsp; Open-eyed, open-mouthed, she stared
at the tide of foaming steeds, like a maiden martyr gazing at the
on-rushing waves of ocean!&nbsp; &ldquo;Caramba!&rdquo; said
Marmalada, &ldquo;voil&agrave; une jeune fille pas trop bien
gard&eacute;e!&rdquo;&nbsp; Giovanelli turned pale, and,
muttering <i>Corpo di Bacco</i>, quaffed a <i>carafon</i> of
green Chartreuse, holding at least a quart, which stood by him in
its native pewter.&nbsp; Young Ponto merely muttered,
&ldquo;Egad!&rdquo;&nbsp; I leaped through the open window and
landed at her feet.</p>
<p>The racing steeds were within ten yards of us.&nbsp; Calmly I
cast my eye over their points.&nbsp; Far the fleetest, though he
did not hold the lead, was Marmalada&rsquo;s charger, the Atys
gelding, by Celerima out of Sac de Nuit.&nbsp; With one wave of
my arm I had placed her on his crupper, and, with the same
action, swung myself into the saddle.&nbsp; Then, in a flash and
thunder of flying horses, we swept like tawny lightning down the
Pincian.&nbsp; The last words I heard from the club window,
through the heliotrope-scented air, were &ldquo;Thirty to one on
Atys, half only if declared.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were wagering on
our lives; the slang of the paddock was on their lips.</p>
<p>Onward, downward, we sped, the fair stranger lifeless in my
arms.&nbsp; Past scarlet cardinals in mufti, past brilliant
&#941;&tau;&#8118;&iota;&rho;&alpha;&#8054; like those who swayed
the City of the Violet Crown; past <i>pifferari</i> dancing in
front of many an <i>albergo</i>; through the Ghetto with its
marmorine palaces, over the Fountain of Trevi, across the
Cascine, down the streets of the Vatican we flew among yells of
&ldquo;Owner&rsquo;s up,&rdquo; &ldquo;The gelding wins, hard
held,&rdquo; from the excited <i>bourgeoisie</i>.&nbsp; Heaven
and earth swam before my eyes as we reached the Pons Sublicia,
and heard the tawny waters of Tiber swaying to the sea.</p>
<p><i>The Pons Sublicia was up</i>!</p>
<p>With an oath of despair, for life is sweet, I rammed my
persuaders into Atys, caught him by the head, and sent him
straight at the flooded Tiber!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Va-t-en donc</i>, <i>esp&egrave;ce de
type</i>!&rdquo; said the girl on my saddle-bow, finding her
tongue at last.&nbsp; Fear, or girlish modesty, had hitherto kept
her silent.</p>
<p>Then Atys rose on his fetlocks!&nbsp; Despite his double
burden, the good steed meant to have it.&nbsp; He deemed,
perchance, he was with the Quorn or the Baron&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He
rose; he sprang.&nbsp; The deep yellow water, cold in the
moon&rsquo;s rays, with the farthest bank but a chill grey line
in the mist, lay beneath us!&nbsp; A moment that seemed an
eternity!&nbsp; Then we landed on the far-off further bank, and
for the first time I could take a pull at his head.&nbsp; I
turned him on the river&rsquo;s brim, and leaped him back
again.</p>
<p>The runaway was now as tame as a driven deer in Richmond
Park.</p>
<p>Well, Camarada, the adventure is over.&nbsp; She was grateful,
of course.&nbsp; These <i>pervenche</i> eyes were suffused with a
dewy radiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t call,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for you
haven&rsquo;t been introduced, and Mrs. Walker says we must be
more exclusive.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m dying to be exclusive; but
I&rsquo;m very much obliged to you, and so will mother be.&nbsp;
Let&rsquo;s see.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be at the Colosseum to-morrow
night, about ten.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m bound to see the Colosseum, by
moonlight.&nbsp; Good-bye;&rdquo; and she shook her pale parasol
at me, and fluttered away.</p>
<p>Ah, Camarada, shall I be there?&nbsp; <i>Que

the Holy Father&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Adieu, Carissima.&mdash;Tout

<p class="gutsumm">Mr. Redmond Barry (better known as Barry
Lyndon) tells his uncle the story of a singular encounter at
Berlin with Mr. Alan Stuart, called Alan Breck, and well known as
the companion of Mr. David Balfour in many adventures.&nbsp; Mr.
Barry, at this time, was in the pay of Herr Potzdorff, of his
Prussian Majesty&rsquo;s Police, and was the associate of the
Chevalier, his kinsman, in the pursuit of fortune.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Berlin, April 1, 1748.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Uncle Barry</span>,&mdash;I dictate to
Pippi, my right hand being wounded, and that by no common
accident.&nbsp; Going down the Linden Strasse yesterday, I
encountered a mob; and, being curious in Potzdorff&rsquo;s
interest, penetrated to the kernel of it.&nbsp; There I found two
men of my old regiment&mdash;Kurz and another&mdash;at words with
a small, dark, nimble fellow, who carried bright and dancing eyes
in a pock-marked face.&nbsp; He had his iron drawn, a heavy
box-handled cut-and-thrust blade, and seemed ready to fall at
once on the pair that had been jeering him for his strange
speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this, lads?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ein Engl&auml;nder,&rdquo; answered they.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Englishman,&rdquo; says he, in a curious accent not
unlike our brogue, &ldquo;but a plain gentleman, though he bears
a king&rsquo;s name and hath Alan Breck to his
by-name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; says I in German, &ldquo;let the
gentleman go his way; he is my own countryman.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
was true enough for them; and you should have seen the
Highlander&rsquo;s eyes flash, and grow dim again.</p>
<p>I took his arm, for Potzdorff will expect me to know all about
the stranger, and marched him down to the <i>Drei
K&ouml;nige</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am your host, sir; what do you call for, Mr. Stuart
of &mdash;?&rdquo; said I, knowing there is never a Scot but has
the name of his kailyard tacked to his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A King&rsquo;s name is good enough for me; I bear it
plain.&nbsp; Mr. &mdash;?&rdquo; said he, reddening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They call me the Chevalier Barry, of
Ballybarry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in the better company, sir,&rdquo; quoth he, with
a grand bow.</p>
<p>When a bowl of punch was brought he takes off his hat, and
drinks, very solemnly, &ldquo;To the King!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the water?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, sir, on <i>this</i> side,&rdquo; he said; and I
smoked the Jacobite.&nbsp; But to shorten the story, which amuses
my tedium but may beget it in you, I asked him if he knew the
cards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just daft when I get to the cartes,&rdquo; he
answered in his brogue, and we fell to piquet.&nbsp; Now my Scot
wore a very fine coat, and on the same very large smooth silver
buttons, well burnished.&nbsp; Therefore, perceiving such an
advantage as a skilled player may enjoy, I let him win a little
to whet his appetite, but presently used his buttons as a mirror,
wherein I readily detected the strength of the cards he
held.&nbsp; Before attempting this artifice, I had solemnly
turned my chair round thrice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have changed the luck, sir,&rdquo; says Mr. Breck,
or Stuart, presently; and, rising with a mighty grave air, he
turned his coat and put it on inside out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;what am I to understand by
this conduct?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for should not I turn my coat, for luck, if you
turn your chair?&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;But if you are not
preceesely satisfied, I will be proud to step outside with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered that we were not in a Highland wilderness, and that
if no malice were meant no affront was taken.&nbsp; We continued
at the game till, though deprived of my mirror, I had won some
500 Fredericks.&nbsp; On this he rose, saying, &ldquo;Sir, in
this purse you will find the exact sum that I am owing you, and I
will call for my empty sporran the morn.&nbsp; It was Rob
Roy&rsquo;s before it was mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therewith he laid on
the table a sort of goatskin pouch, such as Highlanders gird
about their loins, and marched forth.</p>
<p>I set to work at opening his pouch, that was fastened by a
spring and button, seeming easy enough of access.&nbsp; But I had
scarce pressed the button when lo! a flash, a pistol shot, and my
right hand is grazed with a bullet that flew out of the
bag.&nbsp; This Highlander of the Devil had some mechanism in his
purse that discharged a small steel pistol when unwarily
opened.&nbsp; My hand is but slightly wounded, yet I cannot hold
my sword, nor hath my search brought me any news of Alan
Breck.&nbsp; He has vanished like an emissary of the Devil or the
Pretender, as I doubt not he is.&nbsp; But I will have his blood,
if he is not one of their Scotch fairies.&mdash;Your loving
Nephew,</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>From Mrs. Gamp to Mrs.
Prig</i>.</p>
<p class="gutsumm">Mrs. Gamp nurses an old friend who is under a
singular delusion.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Todgers&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My precious Betsy</span>,&mdash;Which when
last we parted it was not as I could wish, but bearing malice in
our hearts.&nbsp; But, as often and often Mrs. Harris have said
it before me, with the tears in her angel eyes&mdash;one of them
having a slight cast from an accident with the moderator lamp,
Harris being quick in his temper&mdash;often and often have she
said to me: &ldquo;Ah, Sairey, the quarrels of friends is
affection&rsquo;s best restorer.&rdquo;&nbsp; And good reason to
know it she have, with a husband as was ever true, and never gave
her no cause to form the wish to pizen them as has good looks,
but, for I will not deceive you, ready with his hands.</p>
<p>And so, between you and me may it be, Betsy Prig, as was
constant partners afore them Chuzzlewidges, and Nadgetts, and
Lewsomses, and Tiggses, and Chuffeys got that mixed and that
aggerawating that to remember who of them poisoned which or for
why in a slime draught, it makes my poor head go round, nor could
such be soothing to the temper.&nbsp; So let bygones be bygones
between us.&nbsp; For, wanting of my Betsy, I am now in a nice
state of confusion, with a patient as was well beknown to me in
younger days, when there wasn&rsquo;t so much of a shadder on
this mortial vial, <a name="citation43"></a><a href="#footnote43"
class="citation">[43]</a> meaning Mr. Pecksniff.&nbsp; Which you
will not forget of him, by reason of his daughter as married that
Jonadge, and his collars as mints of money must have gone to the
getting them up; but is now at Todgers&rsquo;s, and confused in
his poor mind, thinking hisself Somebody else high in
Parliament.&nbsp; And wonder at it I do not, them Chuzzlewidges
and Chuffeys being that distracting, and ever proving to be some
other pusson in disguise, as would confuge a calkilating boy.</p>
<p>So being applied to for to nightly him, there in that very
sick room&mdash;for why should I deceive you?&mdash;I meets the
daily nuss; and, Betsy, I was that overcome to have such a
pardner propoged to me as I had to ring and ask the young woman
immediate for a small glass of their oldest rum, being what I am
not accustomed to but having had a turn.&nbsp; For, will you
believe it, she was not a widger woman as has experience in the
ways of men, but a huzzy in a bragian cap like them the Nuns wear
in &ldquo;Mariar Monk,&rdquo; as you may have seen it in the
small sweet-shops, at a penny.&nbsp; And her hands as white as
her papistry cap, and she a turning up of her nose at what I had
took, and a presuming to give <i>me</i> advice about nussing, as
St. Pancradge&rsquo;s Churchyard wouldn&rsquo;t hold them
I&rsquo;ve seen comfortable to their long homes, and no
complaints made but ever the highest satigefaction.&nbsp; So I
ups and gives her a bit of my mind; and Mrs. Todgers coming down,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s she goes or me,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;for never
will Sairey Gamp nuss, sick or monthly, with a pardner as has not
confidence in me, nor I in her, but contrary.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
<i>she</i> says she&rsquo;ll go and speak to the doctor about it;
and out she tramps with her nose in the air, and sneezing most
awful, not being accustomed to that which I take, find it
strengthening, but as it have been a cause of sorrow and strife
let it be nameless between you and me.&nbsp; For to have the name
&ldquo;Snuffey&rdquo; brought forward it is what the heart can
forgive, but never forget in this valley of the shaddock.</p>
<p>I have nussed a many lunacies, Betsy, and in a general way am
dispoged to humour them rather than set them right up agin the
fire when fractious.&nbsp; But this Pecksniff is the tryingest
creature; he having got it in his mind as he is Somebody very
high, and talking about the House, and Bills, and clauses, and
the &ldquo;sacred cause of Universal Anarchy,&rdquo; for such was
his Bible language, though meaning to me no more than the babe
unborn.&nbsp; Whereby Mrs. Harris she have often said to me,
&ldquo;What <i>do</i> them blessed infants occupy their little
minds with afore they are called into that condition where,
unless changed at nuss, Providence have appointed them?&rdquo;
And many a time have I said, &ldquo;Seek not, Mrs. Harris, to
diskiver; for we know not wot&rsquo;s hidden in our own hearts,
and the torters of the Imposition should not make me diwulge
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Pecksniff is that aggravating as I can hardly heed the
words I now put on the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of my birds have left me,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;for the stranger&rsquo;s breast, and one have took wing
for the Government benches. <a name="citation47"></a><a
href="#footnote47" class="citation">[47]</a>&nbsp; But I have
ever sacrificed my country&rsquo;s happiness to my own, and I
will not begin to regulate my life by other rules of conduct
now.&nbsp; I know the purity of my own motives, and while my
Merry, my little Sir William, playful warbler, prattles under
this patriarchal wing, and my Cherry, my darling Morley, supports
the old man&rsquo;s tottering walk, I can do without my Goschy,
my dears, I can do without him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And wants to borrer
<i>my</i> umbreller for them &ldquo;to rally round,&rdquo; the
bragian idgiot!</p>
<p>A chattering creature he always were, and will be; but, Betsy,
I have this wery momink fixed him up with a shoehorn in his
mouth, as was lying round providential, and the strings of my
bonnet, and the last word as he will say this blessed night was
some lunacy about &ldquo;denouncing the clogeure,&rdquo; as
won&rsquo;t give much more trouble now.</p>
<p>So having rung for a shilling&rsquo;s worth of gin-and-water
warm, and wishing you was here to take another of the same, I
puts my lips to it, and drinks to one as was my frequent pardner
in this mortial vale, and am, as in old days, my Betsy&rsquo;s
own</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>From Herodotus of Halicarnassus
to Sophocles the Athenian</i>.</p>
<p class="gutsumm">Herodotus describes, in a letter to his friend
Sophocles, a curious encounter with a mariner just returned from
unknown parts of Africa.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> Sophocles, the Athenian,
greeting.&nbsp; Yesterday, as I was going down to the
market-place of Naucratis, I met Nicaret&ecirc;, who of all the
<i>hetairai</i> in this place is the most beautiful.&nbsp; Now,
the <i>hetairai</i> of Naucratis are wont somehow to be
exceedingly fair, beyond all women whom we know.&nbsp; She had
with her a certain Phoc&aelig;an mariner, who was but now
returned from a voyage to those parts of Africa which lie below
Arabia; and she saluted me courteously, as knowing that it is my
wont to seek out and inquire the tidings of all men who have
intelligence concerning the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hail to thee, Nicaret&ecirc;,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;verily thou art this morning as lovely as the dawn, or as
the beautiful Rhodopis that died ere thou wert born to us through
the favour of Aphrodite.&rdquo; <a name="citation50"></a><a
href="#footnote50" class="citation">[50]</a></p>
<p>Now this Rhodopis was she who built, they say, the Pyramid of
Mycerinus: wherein they speak not truly but falsely, for Rhodopis
lived long after the kings who built the Pyramids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhodopis died not, O Herodotus,&rdquo; said
Nicaret&ecirc;, &ldquo;but is yet living, and as fair as ever she
was; and he who is now my lover, even this Phanes of
Phoc&aelig;a, hath lately beheld her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she seemed to me to be jesting, like that scribe who told
me of Kr&ocirc;phi and M&ocirc;phi; for Rhodopis lived in the
days of King Amasis and of Sappho the minstrel, and was beloved
by Charaxus, the brother of Sappho, wherefore Sappho reviled him
in a song.&nbsp; How then could Rhodopis, who flourished more
than a hundred years before my time, be living yet?</p>
<p>While I was considering these things they led me into the
booth of one that sold wine; and when Nicaret&ecirc; had set
garlands of roses on our heads, Phanes began and told me what I
now tell thee but whether speaking truly or falsely I know
not.&nbsp; He said that being on a voyage to Punt (for so the
Egyptians call that part of Arabia), he was driven by a north
wind for many days, and at last landed in the mouth of a certain
river where were many sea-fowl and water-birds.&nbsp; And thereby
is a rock, no common one, but fashioned into the likeness of the
head of an Ethiopian.&nbsp; There he said that the people of that
country found him, namely the Amagardoi, and carried him to their
village.&nbsp; They have this peculiar to themselves, and unlike
all other peoples whom we know, that the woman asks the man in
marriage.&nbsp; They then, when they have kissed each other, are
man and wife wedded.&nbsp; And they derive their names from the
mother; wherein they agree with the Lycians, whether being a
colony of the Lycians, or the Lycians a colony of theirs, Phanes
could not give me to understand.&nbsp; But, whereas they are
black and the Lycians are white, I rather believe that one of
them has learned this custom from the other; for anything might
happen in the past of time.</p>
<p>The Amagardoi have also this custom, such as we know of none
other people; that they slay strangers by crowning them with
amphor&aelig;, having made them red-hot.&nbsp; Now, having taken
Phanes, they were about to crown him on this wise, when there
appeared among them a veiled woman, very tall and goodly, whom
they conceive to be a goddess and worship.&nbsp; By her was
Phanes delivered out of their hands; and &ldquo;she kept him in
her hollow caves having a desire that he should be her
lover,&rdquo; as Homer says in the Odyssey, if the Odyssey be
Homer&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And Phanes reports of her that she is the
most beautiful woman in the world, but of her coming thither,
whence she came or when, she would tell him nothing.&nbsp; But he
swore to me, by him who is buried at Thebes (and whose name in
such a matter as this it is not holy for me to utter), that this
woman was no other than Rhodopis the Thracian.&nbsp; For there is
a portrait of Rhodopis in the temple of Aphrodite in Naucratis,
and, knowing this portrait well, Phanes recognised by it that the
woman was Rhodopis. <a name="citation53"></a><a
href="#footnote53" class="citation">[53]</a>&nbsp; Therefore
Rhodopis is yet living, being now about one hundred and fifty
years of age.&nbsp; And Phanes added that there is in the country
of the Amagardoi a fire; and whoso enters into that fire does not
die, but is &ldquo;without age and immortal,&rdquo; as Homer says
concerning the horses of Peleus.&nbsp; Now, I would have deemed
that he was making a mock of that sacred story which he knows who
has been initiated into the mysteries of Demeter at
Eleusis.&nbsp; But he and Nicaret&ecirc; are about to sail
together without delay to the country of the Amagardoi, believing
that there they will enter the fire and become immortal.&nbsp;
Yet methinks that Rhodopis will not look lovingly on
Nicaret&ecirc;, when they meet in that land, nor Nicaret&ecirc;
on Rhodopis.&nbsp; Nay, belike the amphora will be made hot for
one or the other.</p>
<p>Such, howbeit, was the story of Phanes the Phoc&aelig;an,
whether he spoke falsely or truly.&nbsp; The God be with
thee.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Mrs. Proudie, wife of the Bishop of
Barchester, admits Mrs. Quiverful into her confidence.&nbsp; Mrs.
Proudie first takes pleasure in a new and pious acquaintance,
Lady Crawley (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Sharp), but afterwards discovers
the true character of this insidious and dangerous woman.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">The Palace, Barchester, July 17.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Letitia</span>,&mdash;The appearance
of mumps in a small family of fourteen like yours, is indeed one
of those dispensations which teach us how mysterious are the
ways!&nbsp; But I need not tell you to be most careful about
cold, which greatly adds to the virulence of the complaint, and
it is difficult for you, in lodgings at Brighton, to keep a
watchful eye on so many at once.&nbsp; May this discipline be
blessed to you, and to the dear children!</p>
<p>I have much to tell you of Barchester.&nbsp; The light worldly
tone of some families in this place (I will not mention the
Grantleys nor the Arabins) has been checked, I hope, by one of
those accidents which surely, surely, are not to be considered
accidents alone!&nbsp; You know how strong is my objection to
fancy fairs or bazaars, too often rather scenes of giddy
merriment than exhibitions of genuine Christian feeling.&nbsp;
Yet by means of one of these (how strangely are things ordered!)
a happy change, I trust, is being brought about in our midst.</p>
<p>You have heard of Hogglestock, though you may never have
visited that benighted and outlying parish.&nbsp; Indeed, I was
never there myself till last week, when Tom felt it his duty
(though woefully misdirected, to my mind, but we are fallible
creatures) to go and open a bazaar in that place for the
restoration of the church. <a name="citation56"></a><a
href="#footnote56" class="citation">[56]</a>&nbsp; I accompanied
him; for I trusted that an opportunity might be made for me, and
that I might especially bear in on the mind of the rector&rsquo;s
wife the absolute necessity of Sabbath-day schools.&nbsp; The
rector is a Mr. Crawley.&nbsp; He led us on our arrival into a
scene of red cloth, wax dolls most indelicately displayed,
cushions, antimacassars, and similar <i>idols</i>.&nbsp; The
Bishop&rsquo;s speech (I composed it myself) you will read in the
&ldquo;Barchester Guardian,&rdquo; which I send you.&nbsp; While
approving the <i>end</i> he rebuked the <i>means</i>, and took
the opportunity to read a much-needed lesson on <i>Jesuitry</i>
and the dangers of worldliness in high ecclesiastical
places.&nbsp; Let those wince who feel a sense of their own
backslidings.&nbsp; When the Bishop had ended, I determined to
walk once through the bazaar just to make sure that there were no
lotteries nor games of chance&mdash;a desecration of our
<i>mites</i> now too, too frequent.&nbsp; As I was returning
through the throng, alas! of <i>pleasure-seekers</i>, and wishing
that I might scourge them out of the schoolroom, Mr. Crawley met
me, in company with a lady who desired, he said, to be presented
to me.&nbsp; He is a distant relation of the well-known county
family, the Crawleys, of Queen&rsquo;s Crawley; the present
baronet, Sir Rawdon, having recently married Miss Jane Dobbin,
daughter of Colonel Dobbin.&nbsp; The lady who was now introduced
to me, and whose <i>still pleasing</i> face wears an aspect of
humble devoutness, was Lady Crawley, mother of the present
baronet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I came here in the
belief that I was discharging a pious duty.&nbsp; My life, alas!
has been one of sore trial, and I only try to do good.&rdquo; . .
.</p>
<p>I was going to say that I had seen her name in a score of
charity lists, and knew her as a patroness of the Destitute
Orange-Girls, the Neglected Washerwomen, and the Distressed
Muffin-Men.&nbsp; But she shook her head; and then, looking up at
me with eyes like a <i>saint&rsquo;s</i> (if our
<i>privileges</i> permitted us to believe in these fabulous
beings of the Romish superstition), she said, &ldquo;Ah,
no!&nbsp; I have always been in the wrong.&nbsp; The beautiful
address of the Bishop of Barchester has awakened me, and
convinced me that the <i>path</i> does not lie through Fancy
Fairs.&nbsp; I have to begin again.&nbsp; Who shall guide
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I trust I am not subject to vanity; but the news that I (for I
composed the Charge, as I may almost call it) had been the
instrument of so affecting a change did not fail to please
me.&nbsp; I thanked Lady Crawley, and expressed my deep interest
in her altered convictions.&nbsp; Finally she promised to come on
a visit to us at the Palace (she usually resides at Bath or
Cheltenham), and has been three days an inmate.&nbsp; Never have
I met a more singular example of what the Truth can do for one
who, as she admits, was long ago a worldling.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
seen the vanity of it,&rdquo; she tells me, with tears in her
eyes; <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>and
from her example I expect an <i>awakening</i> among our
worldlings.&nbsp; They will follow the path of a <i>titled</i>
person.&nbsp; Tom is much interested in his <i>convert</i>, as he
thinks her.&nbsp; Not to <i>me</i> be the glory!&mdash;Your

painted daughter of Heth, and has no more right to the title of
Lady Crawley than <i>you</i> have.&nbsp; I am told that she was
at one time the paramour of Lord Steyne, and that her conduct
made it impossible for her husband to live with her.&nbsp; And
this is the woman who has come within the gates of the palace of
a Christian prelate; nay, more, who has secured his signature to
a cheque of very considerable value.&nbsp; I think my suspicions
were first excited by the disappearance of the brandy in the
liqueur-stand, and by meeting &ldquo;her ladyship&rsquo;s&rdquo;
maid carrying the bottle up to her room!&nbsp; I spoke to the
Bishop, but he would not listen to me&mdash;quite unlike himself;
and even turned on me in her defence.</p>
<p>Entering his study hastily on the following day, I found her
kneeling at his feet, her yellow hair (dyed, no doubt, for she
must be sixty if she is a day) about her shoulders, doing what do
you suppose&mdash;?&nbsp; <i>Confessing herself to the Bishop of

<p>And he was listening to her &ldquo;confession&rdquo; with an
appearance of interest, and with one of her hands in his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serpent!&rdquo; I said&mdash;and her green eyes
glittered just like one&mdash;&ldquo;unhand his

&ldquo;Dear Mrs. Proudie, do not let me monopolise the
Bishop&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; Perhaps I am in the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you shall go out of it,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are one of those who cause Israel to sin.&nbsp; You
bring the Confessional, for it is no better, into the house of a
Prelate of the Protestant Church of England!&rdquo;&nbsp; Would
you believe that she had the assurance to answer me with a
passage from the Prayer Book, which I have often felt certain
must be <i>mistranslated</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pack, madam,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;we know who can
quote Scripture for his own ends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I pretty soon saw her out of the house, though <i>not in
time</i>; for the infatuated Bishop had already given her a
cheque for a sum which I cannot bring myself to tell you, for the
Funds of the Destitute Orange-Girls.&nbsp; Not a penny of it will
they ever see; nor do I approve of such ostentatious alms in any

the Roman &ldquo;cribbed&rdquo; that line, as the vulgar say,
from an epigram in the Anthology?), and you and I will scarce
throw the first stone at the poor man&rsquo;s folly.&nbsp;
However, I am delaying your natural eagerness.&nbsp; So now for
the story of my great discovery.&nbsp; As our friend Bell would
scarce let his dusty broadsheet lumber out of his hands, I was
turning to leave him in no very good humour, when I noticed a
small and rather long octavo, in dirty and crumpled vellum, lying
on the top of a heap of rubbish, Boston&rsquo;s &ldquo;Crook in
the Lot,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo; and
other chap-book trumpery.&nbsp; I do not know what good angel
that watches over us collectors made me take up the thing, which
I found to be nothing less than a copy of old Guillaume
Coquillart.&nbsp; It was not Galliot du Pr&eacute;&rsquo;s
edition, in <i>lettres rondes</i>, but, still more precious had
it only been complete, an example in black letter.&nbsp; I give
you the whole title.&nbsp; First the motto, in the frieze of an
architectural design, &Alpha;&Gamma;&Alpha;&Theta;&Eta;
&Tau;&Upsilon;&Chi;&Eta;.&nbsp; Then, in small
capitals&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Les &OElig;uvres</span><br />

</blockquote>
<p>By bad (or good) luck this rare piece was imperfect&mdash;the
back gaping and three sheets gone.&nbsp; But, in turning over the
leaves, I saw something that brought my heart, as they say, into
my mouth.&nbsp; So, beating down Bell from his upset price of
fourpence to six bawbees, I pushed the treasure carelessly in my
pocket, and never stopped till I was in a lonely place by
Tyne-side and secure from observation.&nbsp; Then, with my knife,
I very carefully uncased Maistre Guillaume, and extracted the
sheet of parchment, printed in black letter with red capitals,
that had been used to line the binding.&nbsp; A corner of it had
crept out, through the injuries of time, and on that, in
Bell&rsquo;s &ldquo;crame&rdquo; (for it is more a crame than a
shop), I had caught the mystic words Runjt macht Gunjt.</p>
<p>And now, I think, Monkbarns, you prick up your ears and wipe
your spectacles.&nbsp; That is the motto, as every one of the
learned family of antiquaries is well aware, and, as you have
often told me, of your great forbear, the venerable and
praiseworthy Aldobrand Oldenbuck the Typographer, who fled from
the Low Countries during the tyrannical attempt of Philip II. to
suppress at once civil and religious liberty.&nbsp; As all the
world knows, he withdrew from Nuremberg to Scotland, and set up
his Penates and (what you may not hitherto have been aware of)
his Printing Press at Fairport, and under your ancestral roof of
Monkbarns.&nbsp; But, what will surprise you yet more, the
parchment sheet which bears Aldobrand&rsquo;s motto in German
contains printed matter in good Scots!&nbsp; This excellent and
enterprising man must have set himself to ply his noble art in
his new home, and in our unfamiliar tongue.</p>
<p>Yet, even now, we are not at the end of this most fortunate
discovery.&nbsp; It would appear that there was little demand for
works of learning and religion in Scotland, or at least at
Fairport; for the parchment sheet contains fragments of a Ballad
in the Scots tongue.&nbsp; None but a poor and struggling printer
would then have lent his types to such work, and fortunate for us
has been the poverty of your great ancestor.&nbsp; Here we have
the very earliest printed ballad in the world, and, though
fragmentary, it is the more precious as the style proves to
demonstration, and against the frantic scepticism even of a
Ritson, the antique and venerable character of those
compositions.&nbsp; I send you a copy of the Ballad, with the
gaps (where the tooth of time or of the worm, <i>edax rerum</i>,
hath impaired it) filled up with conjectural restorations of my
own.&nbsp; But how far do they fall short of the original
simplicity!&nbsp; <i>Non cuivis contingit</i>.&nbsp; As the title
is lacking, as well as the imprint, I have styled it</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">THE FRAGMENT OF THE
FAUSE LOVER AND THE DEAD LEMAN.</p>
<p>O Willie rade, and Willie gaed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Atween the shore and sea,<br />
And still it was his dead Lady<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That kept him company.</p>
<p>O Willie rade, and Willie gaed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Atween the [loch and heather],<br />
And still it was his dead Lady<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That [held his stirrup leather].</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Willie, tak&rsquo; me up by ye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sae far it is I gang;<br />
O tak&rsquo; me on your saddle bow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or [your day shall not be lang].&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gae back, gae back, ye fause ill wife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the grave wherein ye lie,<br />
It never was seen that a dead leman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Kept lover&rsquo;s company!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gae back, gae back frae me,&rdquo; he said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;For this day maun I wed,<br />
And how can I kiss a living lass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When ye come frae the dead?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ye maun haunt a living man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your brither haunt,&rdquo; says he,<br />
&ldquo;For it was never my knife, but his<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That [twined thy life and thee!]&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are to understand, I make no doubt, that Willie had been
too fortunate a lover, and that in his absence&mdash;the frailty
of his lady becoming conspicuous&mdash;her brother had avenged
the family honour according to that old law of Scotland which the
courteous Ariosto styles &ldquo;l&rsquo; aspra legge di Scozia,
empia e severa.&rdquo;</p>

<i>trouvaille</i>.&nbsp; It is, of course, entirely at your

<p style="text-align: center"><i>From Nicholas to the Editor of
the St. James&rsquo;s Gazette</i>.</p>
<p class="gutsumm">It is only too probable that a later
generation has forgotten &ldquo;Nicholas,&rdquo; the sporting
Prophet of &ldquo;Fun,&rdquo; in the reign of Mr. Hood the
younger.&nbsp; The little work, &ldquo;Nicholas&rsquo;s
Notes,&rdquo; in which Mr. W. J. Prowse collected the papers of
the old Prophet, is, indeed, not an &ldquo;edition de
looks,&rdquo; as the aged Seer says, with his simple
humour.&nbsp; From the Paradise of Fiction, however (and the
Paradise of Touts), Nicholas has communicated, perhaps to the
Psychical Society, the following Epistle.&nbsp; His friendly
mention of a brother journalist speaks well for the Old
Man&rsquo;s head and heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">The Paradise of Fiction, Feb. 9,
1888.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;My dear young friend, it
is ten to one, and no takers, that the public, than whom, between
you and me, I do not think much of them, have forgotten Nicholas,
or even never heard of the Prophet.&nbsp; Youth will be served;
and it is now between twenty years since he left off vaticinating
in &ldquo;Fun,&rdquo; during young Mr. Hood&rsquo;s time, of
future sportive events for to come, and came to live <i>here</i>
with the other celebrated characters of Fiction, than whom I am
sure a more mixed lot, though perhaps a little gay.&nbsp; It
having come to the Prophet&rsquo;s knowledge that some of them
was writing letters to &ldquo;The St. James&rsquo;s
Gazette&rdquo; (than which I am sure none more respectable,
though perhaps a little not quite so attentive to sportive
interests as it might be), he have decided that Nicholas will
take up his pen once more, as of old.</p>
<p>The State of the Turf, my dear young friend, since an old but
still handsome bird would freely alight (when not warned off) on
Newmarket Heath, have caused Nicholas some anxiety.&nbsp; Sir,
between you and me, <i>it is rapidly getting no better</i>.&nbsp;
Here is Lord &mdash; (than whom a more sterling sportsman) as
good as saying to Sir &mdash; (than whom, perhaps), &ldquo;Did
you ever hear of a sporting character called
Swindells?&rdquo;&nbsp; And the Prophet <i>have</i> been told
that it may furnish matter for the gentlemen of the long
robe&mdash;which, in my time, many of them was backers of
horses.</p>
<p>And all along of what?&nbsp; Why, of the &ldquo;inexplicable
in-and-out running of horses,&rdquo; as the
&ldquo;Standard&rdquo; says, and as will often happen, you,
perhaps, having a likely dark one as you want to get light into a
high-class autumn handicap.&nbsp; The days is long past since
Nicholas was nuts on the game little Lecturer, but still has the
interests of the Turf at heart; and, my dear young friend, if
horses never ran in and out, where would be &ldquo;the glorious
uncertainty of the sport&rdquo;?&nbsp; On the whole, then, if
asked my opinion on this affair, the Prophet would
say&mdash;putting it ambiguous-like&mdash;&ldquo;Gentlemen, when
there&rsquo;s so much dirty linen to wash, can&rsquo;t you
remember that we&rsquo;re all pretty much tarred with the same
brush?&rdquo;&nbsp; A great politician&mdash;which a lot of his
family is here, Coningsby, and the Young Duke, and many other
sportsmen&mdash;used to say as what the Turf was &ldquo;a
gigantic engine of national demoralisation;&rdquo; which Nicholas
is not quite sure but what he was right for him, though his
language on rather a large scale.&nbsp; Horses running in and out
is inexplicable!&nbsp; Why, gents all, which of us
<i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> do it, if he had the chance to put the pot
on handsome, human nature being what it is, especially
considering the lowness of the market odds as you have often and
often to be content with.&nbsp; In short, the more you stir it
the more it won&rsquo;t exactly remind you of gales from Araby
the Blest; than which a more delightful country, only not to be
found on any atlas as Nicholas ever cast a glance at the map,
however large.</p>
<p>But enough of a subject than which perhaps one more painful to
me; the Prophet having often and often, in early days, been
warned off Newmarket Heath himself, and called a
&ldquo;disreputable old tout,&rdquo; though only labouring in his
vocation.</p>
<p>(Make a new beginning here, please, Printer.)</p>
<p>It have come to the knowledge of the Prophet that his
&ldquo;Notes&rdquo; are not quite so much read as they once was,
partly owing, no doubt, to the book being not so much an
&ldquo;edition de looks&rdquo; as rather a low-lived lot, to a
casual eye, at fourpence; the picture outside representing
Nicholas rather as having had too much for to drink than as a
prominent member of the Blue Ribbon Society, which it did not
exist in his period, nor would it have enjoyed, to any
considerable extent, my personal or pecuniary support, he having
something else to do with his money.&nbsp; (Printer, please put
in a full stop somewhere here, Nicholas being a little out of the
habit of writing for the periodical press.)&nbsp; He have also
heard that it is proposed in literary circles to start a
&ldquo;Nicholas Society&rdquo; for the purpose of printing a
limited edition of my works including my lost treatise of Knur
and Spell, on Japanese paper, illustrated with photo-gravelures;
they having come in since the Prophet&rsquo;s period, though
perhaps a little gay.</p>
<p>But, my dear though exquisite young friends, is there no
better way of rallying round the Prophet than <i>this</i>?&nbsp;
I have heard, from characters in ancient literature, such as
Agamemnon&mdash;than whom a more energetic soldier, though
perhaps a trifle arbitrary&mdash;the Prophet <i>have</i> heard, I
say, that a deal of liquor used to be poured on the graves of
coves like him and me, and that it did them good.&nbsp; This may
be the case, and anyway the experiment is well worth trying;
though, I would say, do not let it be milk, as I gather was
customary in early times, as didn&rsquo;t know any better; but,
if possible, a bottle or two of sherry wine, to which, as is well
beknown, Nicholas was partial.&nbsp; He will now conclude; and
the Prophet hopes that an experiment, than which, I am sure, one
more deeply interesting, will not be deferred; he not much taking
to the liquor here, though the company makes up for a great deal,
especially an Irish officer by the name of Costigan, than whom a
sweeter singer or a more honourable gentleman; and signs himself,
with gratitude for past favours, and kind respects to the Editor
of the &ldquo;Guardian,&rdquo;</p>

Captain Dugald Dalgetty</i>, <i>of Drumthwacket</i>, <i>to the
Most Noble and Puissant Prince James</i>, <i>Earl of
Montrose</i>, <i>commanding the musters of the King in
Scotland</i>.&nbsp; <i>These</i>&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;As touching the
bruit, or <i>fama</i>, as we said at the Mareschal College, I
shall forthwith answer, and that <i>peremptorie</i>.&nbsp; For
this story of the <i>duello</i>, as a man may say (though,
indeed, they that fought in it were not in the dual number, as
your Grecian hath it, but eight soldados&mdash;seven of them
gallant men), truly the story is of the longest; but as your
lordship will have it, though more expert with the sword than the
goosequill, I must even buckle to.</p>
<p>Let your lordship conceive of your poor officer, once
lieutenant and Rittmaster under that invincible monarch, the
bulwark of the Protestant faith, Gustavus the Victorious;
conceive, I say, Dugald Dalgetty, of Drumthwacket that should be,
in Paris, concerned with a matter of weight and moment not
necessary to be mooted or minted of.&nbsp; As I am sitting at my
tavern ordinary, for I consider that an experienced cavalier
should ever lay in provenant as occasion serveth, comes in to me
a stipendiary of my Lord Winter, bidding me know that his master
would speak to me: and that not <i>coram populo</i>, as I doubt
not your lordship said at St. Leonard&rsquo;s College in St.
Andrews, but privily.&nbsp; Thereon I rise and wait on him; to be
brief&mdash;<i>brevis esse laboro</i>, as we said lang
syne&mdash;his lordship would have me to be of his backers in
private rencontre with four gentlemen of the King&rsquo;s
Musketeers.</p>
<p>Concerning the cause of this duello, I may well say
<i>teterrima causa</i>.&nbsp; His lordship&rsquo;s own sister
Milady Clarik was in question; she being, I fear me, rather akin
in her way of life to Jean Drocheils (whom your lordship may
remember; for, the Baillies expulsing her from Aberdeen, she
migrated to St. Andrews, <i>ad eundem</i>, as the saying is) than
like, in her walk and conduct, to a virtuous lady of a noble
family.&nbsp; She was, indeed, as current rumour had it, the
light o&rsquo;love or <i>belle amie</i> of Monsieur
d&rsquo;Artagnan, his lordship&rsquo;s adversary.</p>
<p>But of siclike least said soonest mended.&nbsp; I take cloak
and sword, and follow with his lordship and two other experienced
cavaliers unto the place of rencontre, being a waste croft
whereon a loon was herding goats, behind the Palace of the
Luxembourg.&nbsp; Here we find waiting us four soldados, proper
tall men of their hands, who receive us courteously.&nbsp; He
that first gave cause of quarrel to my Lord Winter bore a worthy
name enough out of Gascony, that is <i>arida nutrix</i>, as we
said at the Mareschal College, of honourable soldados&mdash;to
wit, as I said, he was Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan.&nbsp; To his
friends, howbeit, he gave sic heathen titles as I never saw or
heard of out of the Grecian books: namely, Monsieur Porthos, a
very tall man, albeit something of a <i>lourdaud</i>; Monsieur
Athos; and he that was to be mine own opposite, Monsieur
Aramis.&nbsp; Hearing these outlandish and insolent appellations,
I thought it becoming me, as an honourable cavalier, to resent
this fashion of presenting: and demurred that a gentleman of the
House of Dalgetty of Drumthwacket could neither take affront
from, nor give honourable satisfaction to, a nameless
landlouper.&nbsp; Wherein your lordship, I doubt me not, will
hold me justificate.</p>
<p>Lord Winter homologating mine opinion, he that called himself
Athos drew each of us apart, and whispered the true names and
qualities territorial of these gentlemen; the whilk, as may
befall honourable soldados, they had reason sufficient to conceal
while serving as private gentlemen in a regiment, though
disdaining to receive halberds, as unbecoming their birth.&nbsp;
He that aligned himself forenenst me was styled the Chevalier
d&rsquo;Herblay; and, the word being given, we fell to.</p>
<p>Now, mine adversary declining to fight <i>comminus gladio</i>,
but breaking ground in a manner unworthy of a gallant soldado,
and the place, saving your presence, being somewhat slippery and
treacherous because of the goats that were fed there, I delivered
a sufficient onslaught; and he fell, his sword flying from his
hand.&nbsp; When I had taken his weapon&mdash;the <i>spolia
opima</i>, as we said at Mareschal College&mdash;I bid him rise,
and then discoursed him on the dishonour of such a hasty
defeat.&nbsp; Then, he confessing himself to me that, though
under arms, he was a young fledgeling priest in Popish orders, I
began upon him with such words on his disgracing the noble
profession of arms as might have made him choose to return to his
cloister; when suddenly he fled, and, being young and
light-footed, robbed me, not only of such caduacs and casualties
as an experienced cavalier might well take from his prisoner for
ransom, but also, as now it appears, of my good name.&nbsp; For I
doubt not that this musketeer priest, Monsieur Aramis, or
l&rsquo;Abb&eacute; d&rsquo;Herblay (for he hath as many names as
I have seen campaigns), was the loon that beguiled with a lying
tale the newsman of the &ldquo;Gallo Belgicus.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I
have ever seen that an honourable soldado will give the go-by to
these newsmen and their flying sheets, as unworthy of the notice
of honourable cavaliers; of whom (recommending your lordship for
the truth of my tale to my Lord Winter, now with his gracious
Majesty the King) I am fain to subscribe myself one, and your
lordship&rsquo;s poor officer, as ye shall entreat him,</p>

parley.&nbsp; &ldquo;What,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;what, the happy
Mr. Jones from the West!&nbsp; What brings him here among the
wicked, and how can the possessor of the beauteous Sophia be a
moment from her charms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take not her name,&rdquo; cries my clod-hopper,
&ldquo;into thy perjured mouth.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis herself sends me
here to avenge the best, the most injured . . . &rdquo;&nbsp;
Here he fell a-blubbering!&nbsp; Oh, Belford, the virtue of this
world is a great discourager of repentance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Mr. Jones insists on the arbitrament of the sword .
. . &rdquo; I was beginning&mdash;&ldquo;Nay, none of thy
Frenchified blades,&rdquo; cries he, &ldquo;come out of thy
earth, thou stinking fox, and try conclusions with an English
cudgel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belford, I am no cudgel-player, and I knew not well how to rid
myself of this swasher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jones!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I will fight you how
you will, where you will, with what weapon you will; but first
inform me of the nature of our quarrel.&nbsp; Would you blazon
abroad yet further the malignant tales that have injured both me
and a lady for whom I have none but the most hallowed
esteem?&nbsp; I pray you sit down, Sir; be calm, the light is ill
for any play with cudgel or sword.&nbsp; De la Tour, a bottle of
right Burgundy; Mr. Jones and I have business, and he hath
travelled far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a trice there was a chicken, a bottle, a set of knives and
forks, a white cloth, and a hungry oaf that did eat and
swear!&nbsp; One bottle followed another.&nbsp; By the third Mr.
Jones embraced me, saying that never had a man been more belied
than I; that it was Lord Fellamar, not I, was the villain.&nbsp;
To this effect I own that I did myself drop a hint; conceiving
that the divine Sophia must often have regretted our friend
Fellamar when once she was bound to the oaf, and that Jones was
capable of a resentful jealousy.&nbsp; By midnight I had to call
a chair for my besotted challenger, and when the Avenger was
there safely bestowed, I asked him where the men should carry
him?&nbsp; His tongue being now thick, and his brains bemused, he
could not find the sign of his inn in his noddle.&nbsp; So, the
merry devil prompting me, I gave the men the address of his
ancient flame, my Lady Bellaston, and off they jogged with
Jones.</p>
<p>Was there ever, Belford, a stranger <i>amoris
redintegratio</i> than this must have been, when our Lydia heard
the old love at the rarely shaken doors:</p>
<blockquote><p>Me tuo longas pereunte noctes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lydia,
dormis?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, how little hath Madam Sophia taken by despatching her lord
to town, and all to break my head.&nbsp; My fellow, who carries
this to thee, has just met Fellamar&rsquo;s man, and tells me
that <i>Fellamar yesterday went down into Somerset</i>.&nbsp;
What bodes this rare conjunction and disjunction of man and wife
and of old affections? and hath &ldquo;Thomas, a
Foundling,&rdquo; too, gone the way of all flesh?</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Thy <span
class="smcap">Lovelace</span>.</p>
<p>No news of the dear fugitive!&nbsp; Ah, Belford, my conscience
and my cousins call me a villain!&nbsp; Minxes all.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>From Miss Catherine Morland to
Miss Eleanor Tilney</i>.</p>
<p class="gutsumm">Miss Catherine Morland, of &ldquo;Northanger
Abbey,&rdquo; gives her account of a visit to Mr. Rochester, and
of his governess&rsquo;s peculiar behaviour.&nbsp; Mrs. Rochester
(<i>n&eacute;e</i> Eyre) has no mention of this in her
Memoirs.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Thornfield, Midnight</p>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> length, my dear Eleanor, the
terrors on which you have so often rallied me are become
<i>realities</i>, and your Catherine is in the midst of those
circumstances to which we may, without exaggeration, give the
epithet &ldquo;horrible.&rdquo;&nbsp; I write, as I firmly
believe, from the mansion of a maniac!&nbsp; On a visit to my
Aunt Ingram, and carried by her to Thornfield, the seat of her
wealthy neighbour, Mr. Rochester, how shall your
Catherine&rsquo;s trembling pen unfold the mysteries by which she
finds herself surrounded!&nbsp; No sooner had I entered this
battlemented mansion than a cold chill struck through me, as with
a sense of some brooding terror.&nbsp; All, indeed, was elegance,
all splendour!&nbsp; The arches were hung with Tyrian-dyed
curtains.&nbsp; The ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were
of red Bohemian glass.&nbsp; Everywhere were crimson couches and
sofas.&nbsp; The housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax, pointed out to my
notice some vases of fine purple spar, and on all sides were
Turkey carpets and large mirrors.&nbsp; Elegance of taste and
fastidious research of ornament could do no more; but what is
luxury to the mind ill at ease? or can a restless conscience be
stilled by red Bohemian glass or pale Parian mantelpieces?</p>
<p>No, alas! too plainly was this conspicuous when, on entering
the library, we found Mr. Rochester&mdash;alone!&nbsp; The envied
possessor of all this opulence can be no happy man.&nbsp; He was
seated with his head bent on his folded arms, and when he looked
up a morose&mdash;almost a malignant&mdash;scowl blackened his
features!&nbsp; Hastily beckoning to the governess, who entered
with us, to follow him, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, hang it
all!&rdquo; in an accent of despair, and rushed from the
chamber.&nbsp; We distinctly heard the doors clanging behind him
as he flew!&nbsp; At dinner, the same hollow reserve; his
conversation entirely confined to the governess (a Miss Eyre),
whose position here your Catherine does not understand, and to
whom I distinctly heard him observe that Miss Blanche Ingram was
&ldquo;an extensive armful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evening was spent in the lugubrious mockery of pretending
to consult an old gipsy-woman who smoked a short black pipe, and
was recognised <i>by all</i> as Mr. Rochester in disguise.&nbsp;
I was conducted by Miss Eyre to my bedroom&mdash;through a long
passage, narrow, low, and dim, with two rows of small black
doors, all shut; &rsquo;twas like a corridor in some Blue
Beard&rsquo;s castle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hurry, hurry, I hear the
chains rattling,&rdquo; said this strange girl; whose position,
my Eleanor, in this house causes your Catherine some natural
perplexity.&nbsp; When we had reached my chamber, &ldquo;Be
silent, silent as death,&rdquo; said Miss Eyre, her finger on her
lip and her meagre body convulsed with some mysterious
emotion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Speak not of what you hear, do not remember
what you see!&rdquo; and she was gone.</p>
<p>I undressed, after testing the walls for secret panels and
looking for assassins in the usual place, but was haunted all the
time by an unnatural sound of laughter.&nbsp; At length, groping
my way to the bed, I jumped hastily in, and would have sought
some suspension of anguish by creeping far underneath the
clothes.&nbsp; But even this refuge was denied to your wretched
Catherine!&nbsp; I could not stretch my limbs; for the sheet, my
dear Eleanor, had been so arranged, in some manner which I do not
understand, as to render this impossible.&nbsp; The laughter
seemed to redouble.&nbsp; I heard a footstep at my door.&nbsp; I
hurried on my frock and shawl and crept into the gallery.&nbsp; A
strange dark figure was gliding in front of me, stooping at each
door; and every time it stooped, came <i>a low gurgling
noise</i>!&nbsp; Inspired by I know not what desperation of
courage, I rushed on the figure and seized it by the neck.&nbsp;
It was Miss Eyre, the governess, filling the boots of all the
guests with water, which she carried in a can.&nbsp; When she saw
me she gave a scream and threw herself against a door hung with a
curtain of Tyrian dye.&nbsp; It yielded, and there poured into
the passage a blue cloud of smoke, with a strong and odious smell
of cigars, into which (and to what company?) she vanished.&nbsp;
I groped my way as well as I might to my own chamber: where each
hour the clocks, as they struck, found an echo in the
apprehensive heart of</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>From Montague Tigg</i>,
<i>Esq.</i>, <i>to Mr. David Crimp</i>.</p>
<p class="gutsumm">The following letter needs no explanation for
any who have studied the fortunes and admired the style of that
celebrated and sanguine financier, Mr. Montague Tigg, in
&ldquo;Martin Chuzzlewit.&rdquo;&nbsp; His chance meeting with
the romantic Comte de Monte Cristo naturally suggested to him the
plans and hopes which he unfolds to an unsympathetic
capitalist.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">1542 Park Lane, May 27, 1848.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My Premium
Pomegranate</span>,&mdash;Oracles are not in it, David, with you,
my pippin, as auspicious counsellors of ingenious
indigence.&nbsp; The remark which you uttered lately, when
refusing to make the trumpery advance of half-a-crown on a
garment which had been near to the illustrious person of my
friend Chevy Slime, that remark was inspired.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go to
Holborn!&rdquo; you said, and the longest-bearded of early
prophets never uttered aught more pregnant with Destiny.&nbsp; I
went to Holborn, to the humble establishment of the tuneful
tonsor, Sweedle-pipe.&nbsp; All things come, the poet says, to
him who knows how to wait&mdash;especially, I may add, to him who
knows how to wait behind thin partitions with a chink in
them.&nbsp; Ensconced in such an ambush&mdash;in fact, in the
back shop&mdash;I bided my time, intending to solicit pecuniary
accommodation from the barber, and studying human nature as
developed in his customers.</p>
<p>There are odd customers in Kingsgate Street,
Holborn&mdash;foreign gents and refugees.&nbsp; Such a cove my
eagle eye detected in a man who entered the shop wearing a long
black beard streaked with the snows of age, and who requested
Poll to shave him clean.&nbsp; He was a sailor-man to look at;
but his profile, David, might have been carved by a Grecian
chisel out of an iceberg, and that steel grey eye of his might
have struck a chill, even through a chink, into any heart less
stout than beats behind the vest of Montague Tigg.&nbsp; The task
of rasping so hirsute a customer seemed to sit heavy on the soul
of Poll, and threatened to exhaust the resources of his limited
establishment.&nbsp; The barber went forth to command, as I
presume, a fresher strop, or more keenly tempered steel, and
glittering cans of water heated to a fiercer heat.&nbsp; No
sooner was the coast clear than the street-door opened, and my
stranger was joined by a mantled form, that glided into
Poll&rsquo;s emporium.&nbsp; The new-comer doffed a swart
sombrero, and disclosed historic features that were not unknown
to the concealed observer&mdash;meaning me.&nbsp; Yes, David,
that aquiline beak, that long and waxed moustache, that
impassible mask of a face, I had seen them, Sir, conspicuous
(though their owner be of alien and even hostile birth) among
England&rsquo;s special chivalry.&nbsp; The foremost he had
charged on the Ides of April (I mean against the ungentlemanly
Chartist throng) and in the storied lists of Eglinton.&nbsp; The
new-comer, in short, was the nephew of him who ate his heart out
in an English gaol (like our illustrious Chiv)&mdash;in fact, he
was Prince Louis N&mdash; B&mdash;.</p>
<p>Gliding to the seat where, half-lathered, the more or less
ancient Mariner awaited Poll&rsquo;s return, the Prince muttered
(in the French lingo, familiar to me from long exile in
Boulogne):</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist, goes all well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magnificently, Sire!&rdquo; says the other chap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our passages taken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, and private cabins paid for to boot, in case of the
storm&rsquo;s inclemency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince nodded and seemed pleased; then he asked
anxiously,</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bird?&nbsp; You have been to
Jamrach&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Sire,&rdquo; says the man who was waiting to
be shaved, &ldquo;I can slip from your jesses no mercenary
eagle.&nbsp; These limbs have yet the pith to climb and this
heart the daring to venture to the airiest crag of Monte
d&rsquo;Oro, and I have ravished from his eyrie a true Corsican
eagle to be the omen of our expedition.&nbsp; Wherever this eagle
is your uncle&rsquo;s legions will gather together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well; and the gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Trust Monte Cristo</i>!&rdquo; says the bearded man;
and then, David, begad!&nbsp; I knew I had them!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We meet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Folkestone pier, 7.45, tidal train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be there without fail,&rdquo; says the Prince,
and sneaks out of the street-door just as Poll comes in with the
extra soap and strop.</p>
<p>Well, David, to make it as short as I can, the man of the icy
glance was clean-shaved at last, and the mother who bore him
would not have known him as he looked in the glass when it was
done.&nbsp; He chucked Poll a diamond worth about a million
piastres, and, remarking that he would not trouble him for the
change, he walked out.&nbsp; By this characteristic swagger, of
course, he more than confirmed my belief that he was, indeed, the
celebrated foreigner the Count of Monte Cristo; whose name and
history even <i>you</i> must be acquainted with, though you may
not be what I have heard my friend Chevy Slime call himself,
&ldquo;the most literary man alive.&rdquo;&nbsp; A desperate
follower of the star of Austerlitz from his youth, a martyr to
the cause in the Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;If, Monte Cristo has not
deserted it now that he has come into his own&mdash;or anybody
else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Of course I was after him like a shot.&nbsp; He walked down
Kingsgate Street and took a four-wheeler that was loitering at
the corner.&nbsp; I followed on foot, escaping the notice of the
police from the fact, made only too natural by Fortune&rsquo;s
cursed spite, that under the toga-like simplicity of Montague
Tigg&rsquo;s costume these minions merely guessed at a
cab-tout.</p>
<p>Well, David, he led me a long chase.&nbsp; He got out of the
four-wheeler (it was dark now) at the Travellers&rsquo;, throwing
the cabman a purse&mdash;of sequins, no doubt.&nbsp; At the door
of the Travellers&rsquo; he entered a brougham; and, driving to
the French Embassy in Albert Gate, he alighted, <i>in different
togs</i>, quite the swell, and <i>let himself in with his own
latch-key</i>.</p>
<p>In fact, Sir, this conspirator of barbers&rsquo; shops, this
prisoner of the Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;If, this climber of
Corsican eyries, is to-day the French Minister accredited to the
Court of St. James&rsquo;s!</p>
<p>And now perhaps, David, you begin to see how the land lies,
the Promised Land, the land where there is corn and milk and
honey-dew.&nbsp; I hold those eminent and highly romantic parties
in the hollow of my hand.&nbsp; A letter from me to M. Lecoq, of
the Rue Jerusalem, and their little game is up, their eagle
moults, the history of Europe is altered.&nbsp; But what good
would all that do Montague Tigg?&nbsp; Will it so much as put
that delightful coin, a golden sovereign, in the pocket of his
nether garments?&nbsp; No, Tigg is no informer; a man who has
charged at the head of his regiment on the coast of Africa is no
vulgar spy.&nbsp; There is more to be got by making the Count pay
through the nose, as we say; <i>chanter</i>, as the French say;
&ldquo;sing a song of sixpence&rdquo;&mdash;to a golden tune.</p>
<p>But, as Fortune now uses me, I cannot personally approach his
Excellency.&nbsp; Powdered menials would urge me from his
portals.&nbsp; An advance, a small advance&mdash;say
30<i>l.</i>&mdash;is needed for preliminary expenses: for the
charges of the clothier, the bootmaker, the hosier, the
barber.&nbsp; Give me 30<i>l.</i> for the restoration of Tigg to
the semblance of the Montagues, and with that sum I conquer
millions.&nbsp; The diamonds of Monte Cristo, the ingots, the
rubies, the golden crowns with the image and superscription of
Pope Alexander VI.&mdash;all are mine: I mean are ours.</p>
<p>More, David; more, my premium tulip: we shall make the Count a
richer man than ever he has been.&nbsp; We shall promote new
companies, we shall put him on the board of directors.&nbsp; I
see the prospectuses from afar.</p>

known each other.&nbsp; It is a pleasant fancy, to me, that they
may have met on the banks of Ouse, while John was meditating a
sermon, and Izaak was &ldquo;attentive of his trembling
quill.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Being now come into the
Land of Beulah; here, whence I cannot so much as see Doubting
Castle; here, where I am solaced with the sound of voices from
the City,&mdash;my mind, that is now more at peace about mine own
salvation, misgives me sore about thine.&nbsp; Thou wilt remember
me, perchance, for him that met thee by a stream of the
Delectable Mountains, and took thee to be a man fleeing from the
City of Destruction.&nbsp; For, beholding thee from afar,
methought that thou didst carry a burden on thy back, even as
myself before my deliverance did bear the burden of my sins and
fears.&nbsp; Yet when I drew near I perceived that it was but a
fisherman&rsquo;s basket on thy back, and that thou didst rather
seek to add to the weight of thy burden than to lighten it or
fling it away.&nbsp; But, when we fell into discourse, I
marvelled much how thou camest so far upon the way, even among
the sheep and the shepherds of that country.&nbsp; For I found
that thou hadst little experience in conflict with Apollyon, and
that thou hadst never passed through the Slough of Despond nor
wandered in the Valley of the Shadow.&nbsp; Nay, thou hadst never
so much as been distressed in thy mind with great fear, nor hadst
thou fled from thy wife and children, to save, if it might be,
thy soul for thyself, as I have done.&nbsp; Nay, rather thou
didst parley with the shepherds as one that loved their life; and
I remember, even now, that sweet carnal song</p>
<blockquote><p>The Shepherd swains shall dance and sing,<br />
For thy delight, each May morning;<br />
If these delights thy mind may move,<br />
Then live with me and be my love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>These
are not the songs that fit the Delectable Country; nay, rather
they are the mirth of wantons.&nbsp; Yet didst thou take pleasure
in them; and therefore I make bold to ask how didst thou flee at
all from the City of Destruction, and come so far upon thy
way?&nbsp; Beware lest, when thou winnest to that brook wherein
no man casts angle, even to that flood where there is no bridge
to go over and the River is very deep&mdash;beware, I say, of one
Vain Hope, the Ferryman!&nbsp; For I would not have thee lost,
because thou art a kindly man and a simple.&nbsp; Yet for
Ignorance there is an ill way, even from the very gates of the
City.&mdash;Thy fellow-traveller,</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>From Piscator to

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I do indeed remember
thee; and I trust thou art amended of these gripings which caused
thee to groan and moan, even by the pleasant streams from the
hills of the Delectable Mountains.&nbsp; And as for my
&ldquo;burden&rdquo; &rsquo;twas pleasant to me to bear it; for,
like not the least of the Apostles, I am a fisher, and I carried
trout.&nbsp; But I take no shame in that I am an angler; for
angling is somewhat like poetry; men are to be born so, and I
would not be otherwise than my Maker designed to have me.&nbsp;
Of the antiquity of angling I could say much; but I misdoubt me
that thou dost not heed the learning of ancient times, but art a
contemner of good learning and virtuous recreations.&nbsp; Yet it
may a little move thee that in the Book of Job mention is made of
fish-hooks, and without reproof; for let me tell you that in the
Scriptures angling is always taken in the best sense.</p>
<p>Touching my flight from the City of Destruction, I love that
place no more than thou dost; yet I fear not its evil
communications, nor would I so hastily desert it as to leave my
wife and children behind therein.&nbsp; Nor have I any experience
of conflict with the Evil One; wherefore I thank Him that hath
set me in pleasant fields, by clear waters, where come no wicked
whispers (be they from Apollyon or from our own hearts); but
there is calmness of spirit, and a world of blessings attending
upon it.&nbsp; And hence can no man see the towers of Doubting
Castle, for the green trees and the hedges white with May.&nbsp;
This life is not wholly vile, as some of thy friends declare
(Thou, who makest thy pilgrims dance to the lute, knowest
better); and, for myself, I own that I love such mirth as does
not make men ashamed to look upon each other next morning.&nbsp;
Let him that bears a heavy heart for his ill-deeds turn him to
better, but not mourn as though the sun were taken out of the
sky.&nbsp; What says the song?&mdash;nay, &rsquo;tis as good balm
for the soul as many a hymn:</p>
<blockquote><p>A merry heart goes all the day,<br />
Your sad one tires in a mile-a!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He that made the world made man to take delight in it; even as
thou saw&rsquo;st me joyful with the shepherds&mdash;ay, with
godly Mr. Richard Hooker, &ldquo;he being then tending his small
allotment of sheep in a common field,&rdquo; as I recount in a
brief life of a good man.&nbsp; As to what awaits me on the other
side of that River, I do expect it with a peaceful heart, and in
humble hope that a man may reach the City with a cheerful
countenance, no less than through groans and sighs and
fears.&nbsp; For we have not a tyrant over us, but a Father, that
loveth a cheerful liver no less than a cheerful giver.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, I thank thee for thy kind thought of one that is
not of thy company, nor no Nonconformist, but a peaceful
Protestant.&nbsp; And, lest thou be troubled with apparitions of
hobgoblins and evil spirits, read that comfortable sermon of Mr.
Hooker&rsquo;s to weak believers, on the <i>Certainty of
Adherence</i>, though they want the inward testimony of it.</p>
<p>But now falls there a sweet shower, &ldquo;a singing
shower&rdquo; saith old George Chapman, and methinks I shall have
sport; for I do note that the mayfly is up; and, seeing all these
beautiful creatures playing in the air and water, I feel my own
heart play within me; and I must out and dape under yonder
sycamore tree.&nbsp; Wherefore, prithee, pardon me a longer
discourse as at this time.&mdash;Thy friend,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They was rattlers; a pair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his teeth he would hold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And another he&rsquo;d wear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a scarf to enfold<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; as safe as the saint was of old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sez William, &ldquo;That same<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; I am fly to his game;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For them rattlers, I think,<br />
Has had all their incisors extracted.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They&rsquo;re harmless as suthin&rsquo; to
drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he betted his pile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could handle them snakes;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he tried, with a smile,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a rattler he takes,<br />
Feeling safe as they&rsquo;d somehow been<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; doctored; but bless you, that sarpent awakes!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waken snakes! and they <i>did</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they rattled like mad;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For it was not a &ldquo;kid,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But some medicine he had,<br />
Injun Joe, for persuadin&rsquo; the critters but<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; William&rsquo;s bit powerful bad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they&rsquo;ve put him outside<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of a bottle of Rye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they&rsquo;ve set him to ride<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A mustang as kin shy,<br />
To keep up his poor circulation; and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; that&rsquo;s the last chance for Bill Nye.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a near thing it is,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the camp&rsquo;s in the
dust.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a pard as we&rsquo;d miss<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If poor Bill was to bust&mdash;<br

If the last of the Nyes were a-sleepin<br />

<p style="text-align: center"><i>From Professor Forth to the Rev.
Mr. Casaubon</i>.</p>
<p class="gutsumm">The delicacy of the domestic matters with
which the following correspondence deals cannot be
exaggerated.&nbsp; It seems that Belinda (whose Memoirs we owe to
Miss Rhoda Broughton) was at Oxford while Mr. and Mrs. Casaubon
were also resident near that pleasant city, so famed for its
Bodleian Library.&nbsp; Professor Forth and Mr. Casaubon were
friends, as may be guessed; their congenial characters, their
kindred studies, Etruscology and Mythology, combined to ally
them.&nbsp; Their wives were not wholly absorbed in their learned
pursuits, and if Mr. Ladislaw was dangling after Mrs. Casaubon,
we know that Mr. Rivers used to haunt with Mrs. Forth the walks
of Magdalen.&nbsp; The regret and disapproval which Mrs. Casaubon
expresses, and her desire to do good to Mrs. Forth, are, it is
believed, not alien to her devoted and exemplary character.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Bradmore-road, Oxford, May 29.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Casaubon</span>,&mdash;In the
course of an investigation which my researches into the character
of the Etruscan &ldquo;Involuti&rdquo; have necessitated, I
frequently encounter the root <i>K&acirc;d</i>,
<i>k</i><sup><i>2</i></sup><i>&acirc;d</i>, or
<i>Q&acirc;d</i>.&nbsp; Schnitzler&rsquo;s recent and
epoch-making discovery that <i>d</i> in Etruscan =
<i>b</i><sup><i>2</i></sup>, has led me to consider it a
plausible hypothesis that we may convert <i>K&acirc;d</i> or
<i>Q&acirc;d</i> into <i>Kab</i><sup><i>2</i></sup>, in which
case it is by no means beyond the range of a cautious conjecture
that the Involuti are identical with the <i>Cab-iri</i>
(Cabiri).&nbsp; Though you will pardon me for confessing, what
you already know, that I am not in all points an adherent to your
ideas concerning a &ldquo;Key to All Mythologies&rdquo; (at
least, as briefly set forth by you in Kuhn&rsquo;s
<i>Zeitung</i>), yet I am deeply impressed with this apparent
opportunity of bridging the seemingly impassable gulf between
Etrurian Religion and the comparatively clear and comprehensible
systems of the Pelasgo-Phoenician peoples.&nbsp; That K&acirc;d
or K&acirc;b can refer either (as in <i>Quatuor</i>) to a
four-footed animal (quadruped, &ldquo;quad&rdquo;) or to a
four-wheeled vehicle (<i>esseda</i>, Celtic <i>cab</i>) I cannot
for a moment believe, though I understand that this theory has
the support of Schrader, Penka, and Baunder. <a
name="citation125"></a><a href="#footnote125"

learning can procure, and your kind courtesy can supply, will be
warmly welcomed and duly acknowledged.&mdash;Believe me,
faithfully yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">James
Forth</span>.</p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;I open this note, which was written from my
dictation by my secretary, Mrs. Forth, to assure myself that her
inexperience has been guilty of no error in matters of so much
delicacy and importance.&nbsp; I have detected no mistake of
moment, and begin to hope that the important step of matrimony to
which I was guided by your example may not have been a rash
experiment.</p>

James Forth</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, <i>Professor of Etruscan</i>,
<i>Oxford</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Forth</span>,&mdash;Your letter
throws considerable light on a topic which has long engaged my
earnest attention.&nbsp; To my thinking, the <i>Cab</i> in
<i>Cabiri</i> = <span class="GutSmall">CAV</span>,
&ldquo;hollow,&rdquo; as in <i>cavus</i>, and refers to the Ark
of Noah, which, of course, before the entrance of every living
thing according to his kind, must have been the largest
artificial hollow or empty space known to our Adamite
ancestors.&nbsp; Thus the Cabiri would answer, naturally, to the
Pat&aelig;ci, which, as Herodotus tells us, were usually figured
on the prows of ships.&nbsp; The Cabiri or Pat&aelig;ci, as
children of Noah and men of the &ldquo;great vessel,&rdquo; or
Cave-men (a wonderful anticipation of modern science), would
perpetuate the memory of Arkite circumstances, and would be
selected, as the sacred tradition faded from men&rsquo;s minds,
as the guides of navigation.&nbsp; I am sorry to seem out of
harmony with your ideas; but it is only a matter of seeming, for
I have no doubt that the Etruscan Involuti are also Arkite, and
that they do not, as Max M&uuml;ller may be expected to intimate,
represent the veiled or cloudy Dawns, but rather the Arkite
Patriarchs.&nbsp; We thus, from different starting-places, arrive
at the same goal, the Arkite solution of Bryant.&nbsp; I am aware
that I am old-fashioned&mdash;like Eum&aelig;us, &ldquo;I dwell
here among the swine, and go not often to the city.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Your letters with little numerals (as <i>k</i><sup>2</sup>) may
represent the exactness of modern philology; but more closely
remind me of the formul&aelig; of algebra, a study in which I at
no time excelled.</p>
<p>It is my purpose to visit Cambridge on June 3, to listen to a
most valuable address by Professor T&ouml;sch, of Bonn, on

Our husbands are not unknown to each other, I may almost call
them friends, but we have met only once.&nbsp; You did not see
me; but I was at Magdalen a few weeks ago, and I could not help
asking who you were, so young, so beautiful; and when I saw you
so lonely among all those learned men my heart went out to you,
for I too know what the learned are, and how often, when we are
young, we feel as if they were so cold, so remote.&nbsp; Ah, then
there come <i>temptations</i>, but they must be

Mr. Rivers (I am informed that is his name) was with you.&nbsp;
Ah, stop and think, and hear me before it is too late.&nbsp; A
word; I do not know&mdash;a word of mine may be listened to,
though I have no right to speak.&nbsp; But something forces me to
speak, and to implore you to remember that it is not for Pleasure
we live, but for Duty.&nbsp; We must break the dearest ties if
they do not bind us to the stake&mdash;the stake of all we owe to
all!&nbsp; You will understand, you will forgive me, will you
not?&nbsp; You will forgive another woman whom your beauty and
sadness have won to admire and love you.&nbsp; You <i>will</i>
break these ties, will you not, and be free, for only in
Renunciation is there freedom?&nbsp; He <i>must not</i> come

<p class="gutsumm">This little controversy on the value of the
herb tobacco passed between the renowned Euphues and that early
but assiduous smoker, Sir Amyas Leigh, well known to readers of
&ldquo;Westward Ho.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(He dissuadeth him from drinking the smoke of the Indian
weed.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir Amyas</span>,&mdash;Take it not
unkindly that a traveller (though less wide a wanderer than thou)
dissuadeth thee from a new-found novelty&mdash;the wanton misuse,
or rather the misuseful wantonness, of the Indian herb.&nbsp; It
is a blind goose that knoweth not a fox from a fern-bush, and a
strange temerity that mistaketh smoke for provender.&nbsp; The
sow, when she is sick, eateth the sea-crab and is immediately
recovered: why, then, should man, being whole and sound, haste to
that which maketh many sick?&nbsp; The lobster flieth not in the
air, nor doth the salamander wanton in the water; wherefore,
then, will man betake him for nourishment or solace to the
fire?&nbsp; Vesuvius bringeth not forth speech from his mouth,
but man, like a volcano, will utter smoke.&nbsp; There is great
difference between the table and the chimney; but thou art for
making both alike.&nbsp; Though the Rose be sweet, yet will it
prove less fragrant if it be wreathed about the skunk; and so an
ill weed from the land where that beast hath its habitation
defileth a courteous knight.&nbsp; Consider, if this practice
delights thee, that the apples of Sodom are outwardly fair but
inwardly full of ashes; the box-tree is always green, but his
seed is poison.&nbsp; Mithridate must be taken inwardly, not
spread on plasters.&nbsp; Of his nature smoke goeth upward and
outward; why wilt thou make it go inward and downward?&nbsp; The
manners of the Cannibal fit not the <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>Englishman; and this thy poison is
unlike Love, which maimeth every part before it kill the Liver,
whereas tobacco doth vex the Liver before it harmeth any other
part.&nbsp; Excuse this my boldness, and forswear thy weed, an
thou lovest</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>From Sir Amyas Leigh to

<p>Whereas thou bringest in a rabble of reasons to convince me, I
will answer thee in thine own kind.&nbsp; Thou art like those
that proffer a man physic before he be sick, and, because his
pleasure is not theirs, call him foolish that is but early
advised.&nbsp; Nature maketh nothing without an end: the eye to
see with, the ear to hear, the herb tobacco to be smoked.&nbsp;
As wine strengtheneth and meat maketh full, tobacco maketh the
heart at rest.&nbsp; Helen gave Nepenthe to them that sorrowed,
and Heaven hath made this weed for such as lack comfort.&nbsp;
Tobacco is the hungry man&rsquo;s food, the wakeful man&rsquo;s
sleep, the weary man&rsquo;s rest, the old man&rsquo;s defence
against melancholy, the busy man&rsquo;s repose, the talkative
man&rsquo;s muzzle, the lonely man&rsquo;s companion.&nbsp;

<p class="gutsumm">That Dean Maitland should have taken the
political line indicated in Mr. Rondelet&rsquo;s letter will
amaze no reader of &lsquo;The Silence of Dean
Maitland.&rsquo;&nbsp; That Mr. Paul Rondelet flew from his penny
paper to a Paradise meet for him is a matter of congratulation to
all but his creditors.&nbsp; He really is now in the only true
Monastery of Thelema, and is simply dressed in an eye-glass and a
cincture of pandanus flowers.&nbsp; The natives worship him, and
he is the First &AElig;sthetic Beach-comber.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Te-a-Iti, The Pacific.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Maitland</span>,&mdash;As my old
friend and tutor at Lothian, you ask me to join the Oxford Home
Rule Association.&nbsp; Excuse my delay in answering.&nbsp; Your
letter was sent to that detested and long-deserted newspaper
office in Fleet Street, and from Fleet Street to Te-a-Iti; thank
Heaven! it is a long way.&nbsp; Were I at home, and still
endeavouring to sway the masses, I might possibly accept your
invitation.&nbsp; I dislike crowds, and I dislike shouting; but
if shout I must, like you I would choose to chime in with the
dingier and the larger and the more violent assembly.&nbsp; But,
having perceived that the masses were very perceptibly learning
to sway themselves, I have retired to Te-a-Iti.&nbsp; You have
read &ldquo;Epipsychidion,&rdquo; my dear Dean?&nbsp; And, in
your time, no doubt you have loved? <a name="citation140"></a><a
href="#footnote140" class="citation">[140]</a>&nbsp; Well, this
is the Isle of Love, described, as in a dream, by the rapt fancy
of Shelley.&nbsp; Urged, perhaps, by a reminiscence of the Great
Aryan wave of migration, I have moved westward to this
Paradise.&nbsp; Like Obermann, I hide my head &ldquo;from the
wild tempest of the age,&rdquo; but in a much dearer place than
&ldquo;chalets near the Alpine snow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Long ago I
said, to one who would not listen, that &ldquo;all the religions
of the world are based on false foundations, resting on the
Family, and fatally unsound.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here the Family, in our
sense, has not been developed.&nbsp; Here no rules trammel the
best and therefore the most evanescent of our affections.&nbsp;
And as for Religion, it is based upon Me, on Rondelet of
Lothian.&nbsp; Here nobody asks me why or how I am
&ldquo;superior.&rdquo;&nbsp; The artless natives at once
perceived the fact, recognised me as a god, and worship me (do
not shudder, my good Dean) with floral services.&nbsp; In
Te-a-Iti (vain to look for it on the map!) I have found my
place&mdash;a place far from the babel of your brutal politics, a
place where I am addressed in liquid accents of adoration.</p>
<p>You may ask whether I endeavour to raise the islanders to my
own level?&nbsp; It is the last thing that I would attempt.&nbsp;
Culture they do not need: their dainty hieratic precisions of
ritual are a sufficient culture in themselves.&nbsp; As I said
once before, &ldquo;it is an absurdity to speak of married people
being one.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here we are an indefinite number; and no
jealousy, no ambitious exclusiveness, mars the happiness of
all.&nbsp; This is the Higher Life about which we used ignorantly
to talk.&nbsp; Here the gross temporal necessities are satisfied
with a breadfruit, a roasted fish, and a few pandanus
flowers.&nbsp; The rest is all climate and the affections.</p>
<p>Conceive, my dear Dean, the undisturbed felicity of life
without newspapers!&nbsp; Empires may fall, perhaps have fallen,
since I left Fleet Street; Alan Dunlop may be a ditcher in good
earnest on an estate no longer his; but here we fleet the time
carelessly, as in the golden world.&nbsp; And you ask me to join
a raucous political association for an object you detest in your
heart, merely because you want to swim with the turbid democratic
current!&nbsp; You are an historian, Maitland: did you ever know
this policy succeed?&nbsp; Did you ever know the respectables
prosper when they allied themselves with the vulgar?&nbsp; Ah,
keep out of your second-hand revolutions.&nbsp; Keep your hands
clean, whether you keep your head on your shoulders or not.&nbsp;
You will never, I fear, be Bishop of Winkum, with all your
historical handbooks and all your Oxford Liberalism.</p>

discovered Te-a-Iti.&nbsp; This must not be.&mdash;Yours

life I loved&mdash;who has not?&mdash;I wedded.&nbsp; I set about
surrounding myself with rosy cheeks.&nbsp; These cheeks grow
pallid.&nbsp; I call for the aid of Science&mdash;Science sends
in her bill!&nbsp; &ldquo;To the Mixture as Before,&rdquo; so
much to &ldquo;the Tonic,&rdquo; so much.&nbsp; The cheeks are
rosy again.&nbsp; I pour forth the blessings of a father&rsquo;s
heart; but there stands Science inexorable, with her bill, her
items.&nbsp; I vainly point out that the mixture has played its
part, the tonic has played <i>its</i> part; and that, in the
nature of things, the transaction is ended.&nbsp; The bill is
unappeasable.&nbsp; I forget the details; a certain number of
pieces of yellow and white dross are spoken of.&nbsp; Ah, I see
it is fifteen and some odd shillings and coppers.&nbsp; Let us
say twenty.</p>
<p>My dear Honeyman, you who, as I hear, are about to follow the
flutes of Aphrodite into a temple where Hymen gilds the horns of
the victims <a name="citation147"></a><a href="#footnote147"

rescue.&nbsp; You may not have the specie actually in your
coffers; but with your prospects, surely you can sign something,
or make over something, or back something, say a <i>post obit</i>
or <i>post vincula</i>, or employ some other instrument?&nbsp;
Excuse my inexperience; or, I should say, excuse my congenital
inability to profit by experience, now considerable, of
<i>difficulties</i>&mdash;and of friendship.&nbsp; Let not the
sun of May-day go down on Harold Skimpole in

<p style="text-align: right">Cursitor Street, May 1.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Skimpole</span>,&mdash;How would I
have joyed, had Providence placed it within my power to relieve
your distress!&nbsp; But it cannot be.&nbsp; Like the
Carthaginian Queen of whom we read in happier days at dear old
Borhambury, I may say that I am <i>haud ignarus mali</i>.&nbsp;
But, alas! the very evils in which I am not unlearned, make it
impossible for me to add <i>miseris succurrere disco</i>!&nbsp;
Rather am I myself in need of succour.&nbsp; You, my dear Harold,
have fallen among thieves; I may too truly add that in this I am
your neighbour.&nbsp; The dens in which we are lodged are
contiguous; we are separated only by the bars.&nbsp; Your note
was sent on hither from my rooms in Walpole Street.&nbsp; Since
we met I have known the utmost that woman&rsquo;s perfidy and the
rich man&rsquo;s contumely can inflict.&nbsp; But I can bear my
punishment.&nbsp; I loved, I trusted.&nbsp; She to whose hand I
aspired, she on whose affections I had based hopes at once of
happiness in life and of extended usefulness in the clerical
profession, <i>she</i> was less confiding.&nbsp; She summoned to
her council a minion of the Law, one Briggs.&nbsp; <i>His</i>
estimate of my position and prospects could not possibly tally
with that of one whose <i>hopes</i> are not set where the
worldling places them.&nbsp; Let him, and such as he, take
thought for the morrow and chaffer about settlements.&nbsp; I do
not regret the gold to which you so delicately allude.&nbsp; I
sorrow only for the bloom that has been brushed from the soaring
pinions of a pure and disinterested affection.&nbsp; <i>Sunt
lacrym&aelig; rerum</i>, and the handkerchief in which I bury my
face is dank with them.</p>
<p>Nor is this disappointment my only <i>cross</i>.&nbsp; The
carrion-birds of commerce have marked down the stricken deer from
their eyries in Bond Street and Jermyn Street.&nbsp; To know how
Solomons has behaved, and the <i>black</i> colours in which Moss
(of Wardour Street) has shown himself, is to receive a new light
on the character of a People chosen under a very different
Dispensation!&nbsp; Detainers flock in, like ravens to a
feast.&nbsp; At this moment I have endured the humiliation of
meeting a sneering child of this world&mdash;Mr. Arthur
Pendennis&mdash;the emissary of one <a name="citation151"></a><a
href="#footnote151" class="citation">[151]</a> to whom I gave in
other days the sweetest blossom in the garden of my
affections&mdash;my sister&mdash;of one who has, indeed, behaved
like a brother&mdash;<i>in law</i>!&nbsp; My word distrusted, my
statements received with a chilling scepticism by this
<i>Nabob</i> Newcome, I am urged to make some
&ldquo;composition&rdquo; with my creditors.&nbsp; The world is
very censorious, the ear of a Bishop is easily won; who knows how
those who have <i>envied</i> talents not misused may turn my
circumstances to my disadvantage?&nbsp; You will see that, far
from aiding another, I am rather obliged to seek succour
myself.&nbsp; But that saying about the sparrows abides with me
to my comfort.&nbsp; Could aught be done, think you, with a bill
backed by our joint names?&nbsp; On July 12 my pew-rents will
come in.&nbsp; I swear to you that they <i>have not been
anticipated</i>.&nbsp; Yours afflictedly,</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>From S. Gandish</i>,
<i>Esq.</i>, <i>to the</i> &lsquo;<i>Newcome
Independent</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">The Royal
Academy</span>.</p>
<p class="gutsumm">It appears that Mr. Gandish, at a great
age&mdash;though he was not older than several industrious
Academicans&mdash;withdrew from the active exercise of his art
and employed his learning and experience as Art Critic of the
&ldquo;Newcome Independent.&rdquo;&nbsp; The following critique
appears to show traces of declining mental vigour in the veteran
Gandish.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> great gallery has once more
opened her doors, if not to the public, nor even to the
fashionable <i>&eacute;lite</i>, at least to the critics.&nbsp;
They are a motley throng who lounge on Press Days in the
sumptuous halls; ladies, small boys, clergymen are there, and
among them but few, perhaps, who have received the training in
High Art of your correspondent, and have had their eye, through a
lifetime more than commonly prolonged, on the glorious
Antique.&nbsp; And what shall we say of the present
Academy?&nbsp; In some ways, things have improved a little since
my &ldquo;Boadishia&rdquo; came back on my hands (1839) at a time
when High Art and the Antique would not do in this country: they
would not do.&nbsp; As far as the new exhibition shows, they do
better now than when the century was younger and &ldquo;Portrait
of the Artist, by S. Gandish&rdquo;&mdash;at thirty-three years
of age&mdash;was offered in vain to the jealously Papist clique
who then controlled the Uffizi.&nbsp; Foreigners are more affable
now; they have taken Mr. Poynter&rsquo;s of himself.</p>
<p>To return to the Antique, what the President&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Captive Andromache&rdquo; must have cost <i>in models
alone</i> is difficult to reckon.&nbsp; When times were cheaper,
fifty years since, my ancient Britons in &ldquo;Boadishia&rdquo;
stood me in thirty pounds: the central figures, however, were
members of my own family.&nbsp; To give every one his due,
&ldquo;Andromache&rdquo; is high art&mdash;yes, it is
high&mdash;and the Antique has not been overlooked.&nbsp; About
the back-view of the young party at the fountain Mr. Horsley may
have something to say.&nbsp; For my part, there seems a want of
muscle in vigorous action: where are the <i>biceps</i>, where are
the thews of Michael Angelo?&nbsp; The President is a touch too
quiet for a taste framed in the best schools.&nbsp; As to his
colour, where is that nutty brown tone of the flesh?&nbsp; But
the designs on the Greek vase are carefully rendered; though I
have heard it remarked by a classical scholar that these kind of
vases were not in use about Homer&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; Still, the
intention is good, though the costumes are not what <i>we</i>
should have called Ancient Roman when the President was a
boy&mdash;ay, or earlier.</p>
<p>Then, Mr. Alma-Tadema, he has not turned <i>his</i> back on
the glorious Antique.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Roses of
Heliogabalus&rdquo; are not explained in the catalogue.&nbsp; As
far as I understand, there has been an earthquake at a banquet of
this unprincipled monarch.&nbsp; The King himself, and his
friends, are safe enough at a kind of high table; though which
<i>is</i> Heliogabalus (he being a consumptive-looking character
in his coins in the Classical Dictionary) your critic has not
made out.&nbsp; The earth having opened down below, the heads of
some women, and of a man with a beard and his hair done up like a
girl, are tossing about in a quantity of rose-leaves, which had
doubtless been strown on the floor, as Martial tells us was the
custom, <i>dum regnat rosa</i>.&nbsp; So I overheard a very
erudite critic remarking.&nbsp; The composition of the piece
would be thus accounted for; but I cannot pretend that Mr. Tadema
reminds one of either Poussin or Annibale Carracci.&nbsp;
However, rumour whispers that a high price has been paid for this
curious performance.&nbsp; To my thinking the friends of
Heliogabalus are a little flat and leathery in the handling of
the flesh.&nbsp; The silver work, and the marble, will please
admirers of this eccentric artist; but I can hardly call the
whole effect &ldquo;High.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Mr. Armitage&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Siren&rdquo; will console people who remember the old
school.&nbsp; This beautiful girl (somewhat careless in her
attitude, though she has been sensible enough <i>not</i> to sit
down on the damp rock without putting her drapery beneath her)
would have been a true gem in one of the old Books of Beauty,
such as the Honourable Percy Popjoy and my old friend, Miss
Bunnion, used to contribute to in the palmy days of the English
school.&nbsp; Mr. Armitage&rsquo;s &ldquo;Juno,&rdquo; standing
in mid-air, with the moon in the neighbourhood, is also an
example to youth, and very unlike the way such things are
generally done now.&nbsp; Mr. Burne-Jones (who does not exhibit)
never did anything like this.&nbsp; Poor Haydon, with whom I have
smoked many a pipe, would have acknowledged that Mr.
Goodall&rsquo;s &ldquo;David&rsquo;s Promise to Bathsheba&rdquo;
and &ldquo;By the Sea of Galilee&rdquo; prove that his
aspirations are nearly fulfilled.&nbsp; These are extremely large
pictures, yet well hung.&nbsp; The figure of Abishag is a little
too much in the French taste for an old-fashioned painter.&nbsp;
<i>Ars longa</i>, <i>nuda veritas</i>!&nbsp; I hope (and so will
the Liberal readers of the &ldquo;Newcome Independent&rdquo;)
that it is by an accident the catalogue reads&mdash;&ldquo;The
Traitor.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Earl Spencer, K.G.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Moonlighters.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Nos. 220, 221, 225.)&nbsp;
Some Tory <i>wag</i> among the Hanging Committee may have taken
this juxtaposition for wit: our readers will adopt a different
view.</p>
<p>There is a fine dog in Mr. Briton Riviere&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Requiescat,&rdquo; but how did the relations of the dead
knight in plate armour acquire the embroidery, at least three
centuries later, on which he is laid to his last repose?&nbsp;
This destroys the illusion, but does not diminish the pathos in
the attitude of the faithful hound.&nbsp; Mr. Long&rsquo;s large
picture appears to exhibit an Oriental girl being tried by a jury
of matrons&mdash;at least, not having my Diodorus Scriblerus by
me, I can arrive at no other conclusion.&nbsp; From the number of
models engaged, this picture must have been designed quite
regardless of expense.&nbsp; It is a study of the Antique, but I
doubt if Smee would have called it High Art.</p>
<p>Speaking of Smee reminds me of portraits.&nbsp; I miss
&ldquo;Portrait of a Lady,&rdquo; &ldquo;Portrait of a
Gentleman;&rdquo; the names of the sitters are now always
given&mdash;a concession to the notoriety-hunting proclivities of
the present period.&nbsp; Few portraits are more in the style of
the palmy days of our school (just after Lawrence) than a study
of a lady by Mr. Goodall (687).&nbsp; On the other hand, young
Mr. Richmond goes back to the antiquated manner of Reynolds in
one of his representations.&nbsp; I must admit that I hear this
work much admired by many; to me it seems old-fashioned and
lacking in blandness and affability.&nbsp; Mr Waterhouse has a
study of a subject from a poem that Mr. Pendennis, the novelist
(whom I knew well), was very fond of when he first came on the
town: &ldquo;The Lady of Shalott.&rdquo;&nbsp; It represents a
very delicate invalid, in a boat, under a counterpane.&nbsp; I
remember the poem ran (it was by young Mr. Tennyson):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>They crossed themselves, their stars they
blest,<br />
Knight, minstrel, abbot, squire, and guest.<br />
There lay a parchment on her breast<br />
That puzzled more than all the rest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The well-fed
wits of Camelot:<br />
&ldquo;The web was woven curiously,<br />
The charm is broken utterly;<br />
Draw near and fear not, this is I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lady of
Shalott.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I admit that the wonder and dismay of the &ldquo;well-fed
wits,&rdquo; if the Lady was like Mr. Waterhouse&rsquo;s picture
of her, do not surprise me.&nbsp; But I confess I do not
understand modern poetry, nor, perhaps, modern painting.&nbsp;
Where is historical Art?&nbsp; Where is Alfred and the
Cake&mdash;a subject which, as is well known, I discovered in my
researches in history.&nbsp; Where is &ldquo;Udolpho in the
Tower&rdquo;? or the &ldquo;Duke of Rothsay the Fourth Day <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>after He
was Deprived of his Victuals&rdquo;? or &ldquo;King John Signing
Magna Charta&rdquo;?&nbsp; They are gone with the red curtain,
the brown tree, the storm in the background.&nbsp; Art is
revolutionary, like everything else in these times, when Treason
itself, in the form of a hoary apostate and reviewer of
contemporary fiction, glares from the walls, and is painted by
Royal&mdash;mark <i>Royal</i>!&mdash;Academicians! . . .</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;When we met lately
at the hospitable board of our common friend, Benjamin Allen,
Esq., lately elected Professor of Chemistry in the University of
London, our conversation turned (if you can pass me the
intoxicating favour of remembering it) on the glorious science of
chemistry.&nbsp; For me this knowledge has ever possessed
irresistible attractions, from the enormous power which it
confers of heaping benefits on the suffering race of
mankind.&nbsp; Others may rejoice in the advantages which a
knowledge of it bestows&mdash;the power which can reduce a
Hannibal to the level of a drummer boy, or an all-pervading
Shakspeare to the intellectual estate of a vestryman, though it
cannot at present reverse those processes.&nbsp; The
consideration of the destructive as compared with the
constructive forces of chemistry was present, as I recollect, to
your powerful intellect on the festive occasion to which I
refer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; you said (permit me to repeat
your very words)&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, Count Fosco, Alexander&rsquo;s
morning draught shall make Alexander run for his life at the
first sound of the enemy&rsquo;s trumpet.&nbsp; So much chemistry
can achieve; but can she help as well as harm?&nbsp; Nay, can she
answer for it that the lemon which Professor Allen, from the best
and purest of motives, has blended with this milk-punch, shall
not disagree with me to-morrow morning?&nbsp; Can chemistry,
Count Fosco, thus thwart malign constitutional
tendency?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were your words, sir, and I am now ready to answer your
deep-searching question in the affirmative.&nbsp; Prolonged
assiduous application to my Art has shown me how to preserve the
lemon in Milk Punch, and yet destroy, or disengage, the
deleterious elements.&nbsp; Will you so greatly honour science,
and Fosco her servant, as to sup with me on <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>the night
of the twenty-fifth, at nine o&rsquo;clock, and prove (you need

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Many thanks for
your very kind invitation.&nbsp; Apart from the interests of
science, the pleasure of your company alone would be more than
enough to make me gladly accept it.&nbsp; I shall have the
enjoyment of testing your milk-punch to-morrow night at nine,
with the confident expectation that your admirable studies will
have overcome a tendency which for many years has prevented me
from relishing, as I could wish, one of the best things in this
good world.&nbsp; Lemon, in fact, has always disagreed with me,
as Professor Allen or Sir Robert Sawyer will be able <a

to make out he is a British subject.&nbsp; Was rather confused
when took, and kept ejaculating &ldquo;Cold Punch,&rdquo;
apparently with the hope of persuading us that such was his name

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;There has arrived a
frightful misunderstanding.&nbsp; The man you have sent us is not
Fosco.&nbsp; Of Fosco he has only the baldness, the air
benevolent, and the girth.&nbsp; The brand on his right arm is no
more than the mark of vaccination.&nbsp; Brought before the
Commissary of Police, the prisoner, who has not one word of
French, was heard through an interpreter.&nbsp; He gives himself
the name of Piquouique, <i>rentier</i>, English; and he appeals
to his Ambassador.&nbsp; Of papers he had letters bearing the
name Samuel Pickwick, and, on his buttons, the letters P.C.,
which we suspect are the badge of a secret society.&nbsp; But
this is not to the point; for it is certain that, whatever the
crimes of this brigand, he is <i>not</i> Fosco, but an
Englishman.&nbsp; That he should be found in the domicile of
Fosco when that droll had evaded is suspicious (<i>louche</i>),
and his explanation does not permit itself to be
understood.&nbsp; I have fear that we enjoy bad luck, and that M.

<p style="text-align: center"><i>From Mr. Allan Quatermain to Sir
Henry Curtis</i>.</p>
<p class="gutsumm">Mr. Quatermain offers the correct account of
two celebrated right and left shots, also an adventure of the
stranger in the Story of an African Farm.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Curtis</span>,&mdash;You ask me to
give you the true account, in writing, of those right and left
shots of mine at the two lions, the crocodile, and the
eagle.&nbsp; The brutes are stuffed now, in the hall at
home&mdash;the lions each on a pedestal, and the alligator on the
floor with the eagle in his jaws&mdash;much as they were when I
settled them and saved the Stranger.&nbsp; All sorts of stories
have got into the papers about the business, which was simple
enough; so, though no hand with a pen, I may as well write it all
out.</p>
<p>I was up on the Knobkerry River, prospecting for diamonds, in
Omomborombunga&rsquo;s country.&nbsp; I had nobody with me but
poor Jim-jim, who afterwards met with an awful death, otherwise
he would have been glad to corroborate my tale, if it needed
it.&nbsp; One night I had come back tired to camp, when I found a
stranger sitting by the fire.&nbsp; He was a dark, fat,
Frenchified little chap, and you won&rsquo;t believe me, but it
is a fact that he wore gloves.&nbsp; I asked him to stay the
night, of course, and inspanned the waggons in laager, for
Omomborombunga&rsquo;s impis were out, swearing to wash their
spears in the blood of The Great White Liar&mdash;a Portuguese
traveller probably; if not, I don&rsquo;t know who he can have
been; perhaps this stranger: he gave no name.&nbsp; Well, we had
our biltong together, and the Stranger put himself outside a good
deal of the very little brandy I had left.&nbsp; We got yarning,
so to speak, and I told him a few of the curious adventures that
naturally fall to the lot of a man in those wild countries.&nbsp;
The Stranger did not say much, but kept playing with a huge
carved walking-stick that he had.&nbsp; Presently he said,
&ldquo;Look at this stick; I bought it from a boy on a South
African Farm.&nbsp; Do you understand what the carvings
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hanged if I do!&rdquo; I said, after turning it
about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, do you see that figure?&rdquo; and he touched a
thing like a Noah out of a child&rsquo;s ark.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
was a hunter like you, my friend, but not in all respects.&nbsp;
That hunter pursued a vast white bird with silver wings, sailing
in the everlasting blue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everlasting bosh!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;there is no
bird of the kind on the veldt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That bird was Truth,&rdquo; says the Stranger,
&ldquo;and, judging from the anecdote you tell me about the
Babyan woman and the Zulu medicine-man, it is a bird <i>you</i>
don&rsquo;t trouble yourself with much, my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a pretty cool thing to say to a man whose veracity is
known like a proverb from Sheba&rsquo;s Breasts to the
Zambesi.</p>
<p><i>Foide Macumazahn</i>, the Zulus say, meaning as true as a
yarn of Allan Quatermain&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Well, my blood was up; no
man shall call Allan Quatermain a liar.&nbsp; The fellow was
going on with a prodigious palaver about a white feather of
Truth, and Mount Sinai, and the Land of Absolute Negation, and I
don&rsquo;t know what, but I signified to him that if he did not
believe my yarns I did not want his company.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to turn you out,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;for
there are lions around&rdquo;&mdash;indeed they were roaring to
each other&mdash;&ldquo;and you will have a parroty time.&nbsp;
But you apologise, or you go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed his short thick laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am a man who
hopes nothing, feels nothing, fears nothing, and believes nothing
that you tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I got up and went for him with my fists, and whether he feared
nothing or not I don&rsquo;t know; but he scooted, dropping a
yellow French novel, by one Catulle Mendes, that I could make
neither head nor tail of.&nbsp; I afterwards heard that there was
something about this stranger in a book called &ldquo;The Story
of an African Farm,&rdquo; which I once began, but never
finished, not being able to understand most of it, and being
vexed by the gross improbability of the girl not marrying the
baby&rsquo;s father, he being ready and willing to make her an
honest woman.&nbsp; However, I am no critic, but a plain man who
tells a plain tale, and I believe persons of soul admire the book
very much.&nbsp; Any way, it does not say who the Stranger
was&mdash;an allegorical kind of bagman I fancy; but I am not
done with him yet.</p>
<p>Out he went into the dark, where hundreds of lions could be
plainly seen making love (at which season they are very
dangerous) by the flashes of lightning.</p>
<p>It was a terrific yet beautiful spectacle, and one which I can
never forget.&nbsp; The black of night would suddenly open like a
huge silver flower, deep within deep, till you almost fancied you
could see within the gates of heaven.&nbsp; The hills stood out
dark against the illimitable splendour, and on every koppie you
saw the huge lions, like kittens at play, roaring till you could
scarcely hear the thunder.&nbsp; The rain was rushing like a
river, all glittering like diamonds, and then, in the twinkling
of an eye, all was black as a wolf&rsquo;s mouth till the next
flash.&nbsp; The lightning, coming from all quarters, appeared to
meet above me, and now was red, now golden, now silver again,
while the great cat-like beasts, as they leaped or lay, looked
like gold, red, and silver lions, reminding me of the signs of
public-houses in old England, far away.&nbsp; Meantime the donga
beneath roared with the flooded torrent that the rain was
bringing down from the heights of Umbopobekatanktshiu.</p>
<p>I stood watching the grand spectacle for some time, rather
pitying the Stranger who was out in it, by no fault of
mine.&nbsp; Then I knocked the ashes out of my pipe, ate a mealy
or two, and crept into my <i>kartel</i>, <a
name="citation184"></a><a href="#footnote184"
class="citation">[184]</a> and slept the sleep of the just.</p>
<p>About dawn I woke.&nbsp; The thunder had rolled away like a
bad dream.&nbsp; The long level silver shafts of the dawn were
flooding the heights, raindrops glittered like diamonds on every
kopje and karroo bush, leaving the deep donga bathed in the
solemn pall of mysterious night.</p>
<p>My thoughts went rapidly over the millions of leagues of land
and sea, where life, that perpetual problem, was now awaking to
another day of struggle and temptation.&nbsp; Then the golden
arrows of the day followed fast.&nbsp; The silver and blue sky
grew roseate with that wide wild blush which testifies to the
modest delight of nature, satisfied and grateful for her silent
existence and her amorous repose.&nbsp; I breakfasted, went down
into the donga with a black boy, poor Jim-jim, who was
afterwards, as I said, to perish by an awful fate, otherwise he
would testify to the truth of my plain story.&nbsp; I began
poking among the rocks in the dry basin of the donga, <a
name="citation185"></a><a href="#footnote185"
class="citation">[185]</a> and had just picked up a
pebble&mdash;I knew it by the soapy feel for a diamond.&nbsp;
Uncut it was about three times the size of the koh-i-noor, say
1,000 carats, and I was rejoicing in my luck when I heard the
scream of a human being in the last agony of terror.&nbsp;
Looking up, I saw that on either side of the donga, which was
about twenty feet wide, a great black lion and lioness were
standing with open jaws, while some fifty yards in front of me an
alligator, in a deep pool of the flooded donga, was stretching
his open snout and gleaming teeth greedily upwards.&nbsp; Over
head flew an eagle, and <i>in mid-air between</i>, as I am a
living and honourable man, a human being was leaping the
chasm.&nbsp; He had been pursued by the lion on my left, and had
been driven to attempt the terrible leap; but if he crossed he
was certain to fall into the jaws of the lion on my right, while
if he fell short in his jump, do you see, the alligator was ready
for him below, and the great golden eagle watched the business
from above, in case he attempted to escape <i>that</i> way.</p>
<p>All this takes long to tell, though it was passing in a flash
of time.&nbsp; Dropping the diamond (which must have rolled into
a crevice of the rock, for I never saw it again), I caught up my
double-barrelled rifle (one of Wesson &amp; Smith&rsquo;s), aimed
at the lion on the right hand of the donga with my right barrel,
and then hastily fired my left at the alligator.&nbsp; When the
smoke cleared away, the man had reached the right side of the
donga safe and sound.&nbsp; Seeing that the alligator was dying,
I loaded again, bowled over the lioness on the left, settled the
eagle&rsquo;s business (he fell dead into the jaws of the dying
alligator, which closed on him with a snap).&nbsp; I then climbed
the wall of the donga, and there lay, fainting, the Stranger of
last night&mdash;the man who feared nothing&mdash;the blood of
the dead lion trickling over him.&nbsp; His celebrated
allegorical walking-stick from the African Farm had been broken
into two pieces by the bullet after it (the bullet) had passed
through the head of the lion.&nbsp; And, as the &ldquo;Ingoldsby
Legends&rdquo; say, &ldquo;nobody was one penny the worse,&rdquo;
except the wild beasts.&nbsp; The man, however, had had a parroty
time, and it was a good hour before I could bring him round,
during which he finished my brandy.&nbsp; He still wore
gloves.&nbsp; What he was doing in Omuborumbunga&rsquo;s country
I do not know to this day.&nbsp; I never found the diamond again,
though I hunted long.&nbsp; But I must say that two better right
and left shots, considering that I had no time to aim, and that
they were really snapshots, I never remember to have made in my
long experience.</p>
<p>This is the short and the long of the matter, which was talked
of a good deal in the Colony, and about which, I am told, some
inaccurate accounts have got into the newspapers.&nbsp; I hate
writing, as you know, and don&rsquo;t pretend to give a literary
colour to this little business of the shots, but merely tell a
&ldquo;plain, unvarnished tale,&rdquo; as the &ldquo;Ingoldsby
Legends&rdquo; say.</p>
<p>As to the Stranger, what he was doing there, or who he was, or
where he is now, I can tell you nothing.&nbsp; He told me he was
bound for &ldquo;the almighty mountains of Dry-facts and
Realities,&rdquo; which he kindly pointed out to me among the
carvings of his walking-stick.&nbsp; He then sighed wearily, very
wearily, and scooted.&nbsp; I think he came to no good; but he
never came in my way again.</p>
<p>And now you know the yarn of the two stuffed lions and the
alligator with the eagle in his jaws.</p>

that it was &ldquo;settled in a fitting manner,&rdquo; you have

and jesting, than to that respect in which the duello, or single
combat, should be regarded by gentlemen of name and coat
armour.&nbsp; But Sir Hew being dead, and buried with his
fathers, the matter may be broached as among friends and persons
of honour.&nbsp; The ground of our dispute, as ye know, was an
unthinking scoff of Sir Hew&rsquo;s, he being my own third cousin
by the mother&rsquo;s side, Anderson of Ettrick Hall having
intermarried, about the time of the Solemn League and Covenant,
with Anderson of Tushielaw, both of which houses are connected
with the Halberts of Dinniewuddie and with the
Bradwardines.&nbsp; But <i>stemmata quid faciunt</i>?&nbsp; Sir
Hew, being a young man, and the maut, as the vulgar say, above
the meal, after a funeral of one of our kin in the Cathedral
Kirkyard of St. Andrews, we met at Glass&rsquo;s Inn, where, in
the presence of many gentlemen, occurred our unfortunate
dissension.</p>
<p>We encountered betimes next morning, on a secluded spot of the
sands hard by the town, at the Eden-mouth. <a
name="citation190"></a><a href="#footnote190"
class="citation">[190]</a>&nbsp; The weapons were pistols, Sir
Hew, by a slight passing infirmity, being disabled from the use
of the sword.&nbsp; Inchgrabbit was my second, and Strathtyrum
did the same office for my kinsman, Sir Hew.&nbsp; The pistols
being charged and primed, and we aligned forenent each other at
the convenient distance of twelve paces, the word was given to
fire, and both weapons having been discharged, and the smoke
having cleared away, Sir Hew was discovered fallen to the ground,
<i>procumbus humi</i>, and exanimate.&nbsp; The blood was flowing
freely from a face-wound, and my unhappy kinsman was
senseless.&nbsp; At this moment we heard a voice, as of one
<i>clamantis in eremo</i>, cry &ldquo;<i>Fore</i>!&rdquo; to
which paying no heed in the natural agitation of our spirits, we
hurried to lift my fallen opponent and examine his wound.&nbsp;
Upon a closer search it proved to be no shot-wound, but a mere
clour, or bruise, whereof the reason was now apparent, he having
been struck by the ball of a golfer (from us concealed by the
<i>dunes</i>, or bunkers, of sand) and not by the discharge of my
weapon.&nbsp; At this moment a plebeian fellow appeared with his
<i>arma campestria</i>, or clubs, cleeks, irons, and the like,
under his arm, who, without paying any attention to our
situation, struck the ball wherewith he had felled my kinsman in
the direction of the hole.&nbsp; Reflection directed us to the
conclusion that both pistols had missed their aim, and that Sir
Hew had fallen beneath a chance blow from this fellow&rsquo;s
golf-ball.&nbsp; But as my kinsman was still <i>hors de
combat</i>, and incapable of further action, being unwitting,
too, of the real cause of his disaster, Inchgrabbit and
Strathtyrum, in their discretion as seconds, or <i>belli
judices</i>, deemed it better that we should keep a still sough,
and that Sir Hew should never be informed concerning the cause of
his discomfiture.&nbsp; This resolution we kept, and Sir Hew
wore, till the day of his late lamented decease, a bullet among
the seals of his watch, he being persuaded by Strathtyrum that it
had been extracted from his brain-pan, which certainly was of the
thickest.&nbsp; But this was all a bam, or bite, among young men,
and a splore to laugh over by our three selves, nor would I have
it to go abroad now that Sir Hew is dead, as being prejudicial to
the memory of a worthy man, and an honourable family connected
with our own.&nbsp; Wherefore I pray you keep a still sough
hereanent, as you love me, who remain&mdash;Your loving good

197</span>APPENDIX</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Note on Letter of Mr. Surtees to Mr. Jonathan
Oldbuck, p. 64.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">No</span> literary forgeries were ever
much better done than the sham ballads which Surtees of
Mainsforth imposed on Sir Walter Scott.&nbsp; The poems were
spirited and good of their kind; and though we wonder now that
some of them could take in an expert, it is by no means assured
that we are even to-day acquainted with the whole of
Surtees&rsquo; frauds.&nbsp; Why a man otherwise honourable,
kindly, charitable, and learned, exercised his ingenuity so
cruelly upon a trusting correspondent and a staunch friend, it is
hardly possible to guess.&nbsp; The biographers of Surtees
maintain that he wanted to try his skill on Scott, then only
known to him by correspondence; and that, having succeeded, he
was afraid to risk Scott&rsquo;s friendship by a
confession.&nbsp; This is plausible; and if good may come out of
evil, we may remember that two picturesque parts of
&ldquo;Marmion&rdquo; are due to one confessed and another
certain <i>supercherie</i> of Surtees.&nbsp; It cannot be said in
his defence that he had no conception of the mischief of literary
frauds; in more than one passage of his correspondence he
mentions Ritson&rsquo;s detestation of these practices.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To literary imposition, as tending to obscure the path of
inquiry, Ritson gave no quarter,&rdquo; says this arch literary
impostor.</p>
<p>A brief account of Surtees&rsquo; labour in the field of sham
ballad writing may be fresh to many people who merely know him as
the real author of &ldquo;Barthram&rsquo;s Dirge&rdquo; and of
&ldquo;The Slaying of Anthony Featherstonhaugh.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
an undated letter of 1806, Scott, writing from Ashestiel, thanks
Surtees for his &ldquo;obliging communications.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Surtees manifestly began the correspondence, being attracted by
the &ldquo;Border Minstrelsy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus it appears that
Surtees did <i>not</i> forge &ldquo;Hobbie Noble&rdquo; in the
first edition of the &ldquo;Minstrelsy&rdquo;; for he makes some
suggestions as to the &ldquo;Earl of Whitfield,&rdquo; dreaded by
the hero of that ballad, which Scott had already published.&nbsp;
But he was already deceiving Scott, who writes to him about
&ldquo;Ralph Eure,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lord Eure,&rdquo; and about a
&ldquo;Goth, who melted Lord Eure&rsquo;s gold
chain.&rdquo;&nbsp; This Lord Eure is doubtless the &ldquo;Lord
Eurie&rdquo; of the ballad in the later editions of the
&ldquo;Border Minstrelsy,&rdquo; a ballad actually composed by
Surtees.&nbsp; That wily person immediately sent Scott a ballad
on &ldquo;The Feud between the Ridleys and Featherstones,&rdquo;
in which Scott believed to the day of his death.&nbsp; He
introduced it in &ldquo;Marmion.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whiles a
Northern harper rude<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chaunted a rhyme of deadly
feud,<br />
How the fierce Thirlwalls and Ridleys all, &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his note (&ldquo;Border Minstrelsy,&rdquo; second edition,
1808, p. xxi.) Scott says the ballad was taken down from an old
woman&rsquo;s recitation at the Alston Moor lead-mines &ldquo;by
the agent there,&rdquo; and sent by him to Surtees.&nbsp;
Consequently, when Surtees saw &ldquo;Marmion&rdquo; in print he
had to ask Scott not to print &ldquo;<i>the</i> agent,&rdquo; as
he does not know even the name of Colonel Beaumont&rsquo;s chief
agent there, but &ldquo;an agent.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus he hedged
himself from a not impossible disclaimer by the agent at the
mines.</p>
<p>Readers of &ldquo;Marmion&rdquo; will remember how</p>
<blockquote><p>Once, near Norham, there did fight<br />
A spectre fell, of fiendish might,<br />
In likeness of a Scottish knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Brian Bulmer bold,<br />
And trained him nigh to disallow<br />
The aid of his baptismal vow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This legend is more of Surtees&rsquo; fun.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
most singular tale of this kind,&rdquo; says Sir Walter,
&ldquo;is contained in an extract communicated to me by my friend
Mr. Surtees, of Mainsforth, who copied it from a MS. note in a
copy of Burthogge &ldquo;On the Nature of Spirits, 1694,
8vo,&rdquo; which had been the property of the late Mr.
Gill.&nbsp; It was not in Mr. Gill&rsquo;s own hand: but probably
an hundred years older, and was said to be &ldquo;E libro
Convent.&nbsp; Dunelm. per T. C. extract.;&rdquo; this T. C.
being Thomas Cradocke, Esq.&nbsp; Scott adds, that the passage,
which he gives in the Latin, suggested the introduction of the
tourney with the Fairy Knight in &ldquo;Marmion.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Well, <i>where</i> is Cradocke&rsquo;s extract?&nbsp; The
original was &ldquo;lost&rdquo; before Surtees sent his
&ldquo;copy&rdquo; to Sir Walter.&nbsp; &ldquo;The notes had been
carelessly or injudiciously shaken out of the book.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Surtees adds, another editor confirms it, that no such story
exists in any MS. of the Dean and Chapter of Durham.&nbsp; No
doubt he invented the whole story, and wrote it himself in
medi&aelig;val Latin.</p>
<p>Not content with two &ldquo;whoppers,&rdquo; as Mr. Jo Gargery
might call them, Surtees goes on to invent a perfectly incredible
heraldic bearing.&nbsp; He found it in a MS. note in the
&ldquo;Gwillim&rsquo;s Heraldry&rdquo; of Mr. Gyll or
Gill&mdash;the name is written both ways.&nbsp; &ldquo;He beareth
per pale or and arg., over all a spectre passant, <i>shrouded
sable</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;he&rdquo; being Newton, of
Beverley, in Yorkshire.&nbsp; Sir Walter actually swallowed this
amazing fib, and alludes to it in &ldquo;Rob Roy&rdquo;
(1818).&nbsp; But Mr. Raine, the editor of Surtees&rsquo; Life,
inherited or bought his copy of Gwillim, that of Mr. Gill or
Gyll; &ldquo;and I find in it no trace of such an
entry.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord Derwentwater&rsquo;s
Good-Night&rdquo; is probably entirely by Surtees.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
friend of Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s&rdquo; gave him a Tynedale ballad,
&ldquo;Hey, Willy Ridley, winna you stay?&rdquo; which is also
&ldquo;aut Diabolus aut Robertus.&rdquo;&nbsp; As to
&ldquo;Barthram&rsquo;s Dirge,&rdquo; &ldquo;from Ann Douglas, a
withered crone who weeds my garden,&rdquo; copies with various
tentative verses in Surtees&rsquo; hand have been found.&nbsp;
Oddly enough, Sir Walter had once discovered a small sepulchral
cross, upset, in Liddesdale, near the &ldquo;Nine Stane
Rig;&rdquo; and this probably made him more easily
deceived.&nbsp; Surtees very cleverly put some lines, which
<i>could</i> not have been original, in brackets, as his own
attempt to fill up lacun&aelig;.&nbsp; Such are</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[When the dew fell cold and
still,<br />
When the aspen grey forget to play,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the mist clung to the hill.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any one reading the piece would say, &ldquo;It must be
genuine, for the <i>confessed</i> interpolations are not in the
ballad style, which the interpolator, therefore, could not
write.&rdquo;&nbsp; An attempt which Surtees made when composing
the song, and which he wisely rejected, could not have failed to
excite Scott&rsquo;s suspicions.&nbsp; It ran&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>They buried him when the bonny may<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was on the flow&rsquo;ring thorn;<br />
And she waked him till the forest grey<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of every leaf was lorn;</p>
<p>Till the rowan tree of gramarye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its scarlet clusters shed,<br />
And the hollin green alone was seen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With its berries glistening red.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether Surtees&rsquo; &ldquo;Brown Man of the Muirs,&rdquo;
to which Scott also gave a place in his own poetry, was a true
legend or not, the reader may decide for himself.</p>
<p>Concerning another ballad in the
&ldquo;Minstrelsy&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Auld
Maitland&rdquo;&mdash;Professor Child has expressed a suspicion
which most readers feel.&nbsp; What Scott told Ellis about it
(Autumn, 1802) was, that he got it in the Forest, &ldquo;copied
down from the recitation of an old shepherd by a country
farmer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who was the farmer?&nbsp; Will Laidlaw had
employed James Hogg, as shepherd.&nbsp; Hogg&rsquo;s mother
chanted &ldquo;Auld Maitland.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hogg first met Scott
in the summer of 1801.&nbsp; The shepherd had already seen the
first volume of the &ldquo;Minstrelsy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Did he,
thereupon, write &ldquo;Auld Maitland,&rdquo; teach his mother
it, and induce Laidlaw to take it down from her recitation?&nbsp;
The old lady said she got it from Andrew Moir, who had it
&ldquo;frae auld Baby Mettlin, who was said to have been another
nor a gude ane.&rdquo;&nbsp; But we have Hogg&rsquo;s own
statement that &ldquo;aiblins ma gran&rsquo;-mither was an unco
leear,&rdquo; and this quality may have been hereditary.&nbsp; On
the other side, Hogg could hardly have held his tongue about the
forgery, if forgery it was, when he wrote his &ldquo;Domestic
Manners and Private Life of Sir Walter Scott&rdquo; (1834).&nbsp;
The whole investigation is a little depressing, and makes one
very shy of unauthenticated ballads.</p>

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
